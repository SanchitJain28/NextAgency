## Notes

- **Quality > Quantity**: One backlink from a DR70 site beats 10 from DR20 sites
- **Relevance Matters**: eCommerce/Shopify backlinks are worth more than general directories
- **Be Patient**: Backlink building takes 3-6 months to show SEO impact
- **Stay Consistent**: Better to get 5 quality backlinks per month consistently than 50 in one month then nothing

**Last Updated**: November 2025


🚀 1. Write “Link-Magnet” Content

Stuff people actually want to link to:

Ultimate guides

“Top 50” lists

Useful tools (calculators, templates, checklists)

Original research / stats

Make one of these and boom — backlinks start sliding in like DMs after a glow-up.

🤝 2. Guest Posting (the OG but still works)

You write a blog → they publish → you get a backlink.
Hit up:

Medium publications

Industry blogs

Niche sites
Just don’t write AI-spam. Make it sound human and helpful.

🧲 3. HARO / Qwoted (Free High-Quality Backlinks)

Journalists are always begging for quotes.
You reply → they publish → you get backlinks from news sites.

This is chef’s kiss for authority.

📝 4. Create Listable Content

People LOVE listicles:

“15 Best Book Stores in India”

“Top 10 gifting ideas for book lovers”

“Best platforms to sell old books online”

Other sites often scrape this content → instant backlinks.

🎁 5. Link Exchanges (but like… classy)

Don’t do spammy “bro link me I link you” stuff.
Do:

Collaborate with similar niche creators

Publish “collaboration posts” with multiple websites mentioned

🔍 6. Broken Link Building

This one’s smooth:

Find broken links on blogs in your niche.

Tell them “Hey bro this link is dead.”

Offer your content as a replacement.

You look helpful and get a backlink. W move.

🧩 7. Local Backlinks

Since you run DelhiBookMarket:

Get listed on Delhi directories

Add your site to local business listings

Tie up with colleges, libraries, book clubs

These backlinks are low-effort and strong for local SEO.

📦 8. Give Free Value

You create:

Free book summaries

Checklists

Tools like “Book Cost Calculator”
People link to free resources like it's candy.

📱 9. Leverage Your Instagram Page

You already have a book page → use it:

Collaborate with book influencers

Publish blog links in captions/stories

Ask creators if they can list your website as a resource

Social links aren’t strong but they drive traffic → higher SEO.

🧨 10. Skyscraper Method (Ninja Move)

Find a blog in your niche with lots of backlinks

Make a better, more detailed version

Tell every site linking to the old one:
“Hey this resource is updated if you wanna use this instead.”

This works better than 99% of paid link building.

⭐ Bonus: DON’T Do This

Don’t buy cheap backlinks (“200 backlinks for $5” — bro that’s how you get penalized).

Don’t spam comments.

Don’t rely on Web 2.0 trickery.

Google is smarter than your college professor, trust me.

If you want, I can:
✅ Audit your site and tell you EXACT backlink opportunities
OR
✅ Write listicle/blog titles that naturally get backlinks
OR
✅ Create a backlink strategy specifically for DelhiBookMarket

Just say the word. 😎
