# Backend & API Development for Shopify

Build the infrastructure your business needs. Custom backends, APIs, and server-side logic.

Shopify handles the storefront, but sometimes you need custom backend systems for complex business logic, data processing, integrations, or specialized workflows.

We build robust backend systems that scale with your business.

============================================================
WHO THIS IS FOR
============================================================

## Do You Need Custom Backend Development?

### You Need Backend Development If:

**Complex Data Processing**
Real-time analytics, complex calculations, data transformations, batch processing that Shopify's frontend can't handle efficiently.

**Custom Business Logic**
Pricing algorithms, inventory allocation rules, fulfillment routing logic too complex for apps or Shopify's native capabilities.

**High-Performance Requirements**
Operations that need to handle thousands of requests per second, real-time data sync, or heavy computational workloads.

**Advanced Integrations**
Connect multiple systems (ERP, WMS, CRM, custom databases) with complex data transformation and business rules.

**API Development**
Build APIs for mobile apps, partner integrations, or to expose your business data securely to third parties.

**Webhook Processing**
Complex webhook handling, queuing, retry logic, and processing that goes beyond simple integrations.


============================================================
WHAT WE BUILD
============================================================

## Backend Development Services

- **Data Pipelines:** ETL processes for moving data between systems
- **Batch Processing:** Nightly jobs for reports, reconciliation, cleanup
- **Data Aggregation:** Combine data from multiple sources
- **Profit Analysis:** Calculate true profit including COGS, shipping, returns
- **Customer Segmentation:** Advanced RFM analysis, predictive models

**Example:** Built a profit analytics system processing 10K+ daily orders across 5 brands, calculating real-time profit by product, channel, and customer segment. Revealed $180K annual profit leakage.

**Investment:** $20,000-50,000

### Integration Middleware

**Connect Systems Reliably**

- **Multi-System Integration:** Connect 3+ systems with complex rules
- **Data Transformation:** Clean, normalize, enrich data between systems
- **Message Queuing:** Reliable async processing with retry logic
- **Error Handling:** Sophisticated error detection and resolution
- **Monitoring:** Real-time alerts and performance tracking
- **Sync Orchestration:** Coordinate data flow across systems

**Example:** Built middleware connecting Shopify, ERP, WMS, and CRM for a distributor. Handles 500+ orders daily with complex routing rules, customer-specific pricing, and multi-warehouse allocation.

**Investment:** $25,000-60,000

### Custom Business Logic Engines

**Unique Algorithms and Rules**

- **Pricing Engines:** Dynamic pricing, customer-specific pricing, complex discounts
- **Inventory Allocation:** Multi-warehouse, priority rules, safety stock
- **Order Routing:** Route orders based on location, product, customer, inventory
- **Recommendation Engines:** Custom product recommendation logic
- **Fraud Detection:** Custom rules beyond Shopify's basic fraud analysis
- **Subscription Logic:** Complex subscription rules and billing

**Example:** Built a dynamic pricing engine for a B2B distributor with contract-specific pricing, volume tiers, promotional rules, and customer-specific discounts. Handles 200+ customers with unique pricing matrices.

**Investment:** $22,000-55,000

### Serverless Functions

**Event-Driven Processing**

- **Shopify Functions:** Custom discount logic, shipping rates, payment methods
- **Lambda Functions:** AWS Lambda for scalable processing
- **Background Jobs:** Async processing without blocking main flow
- **Scheduled Tasks:** Cron jobs for recurring operations
- **Event Handlers:** React to specific triggers across your systems

**Example:** Built serverless functions for a subscription business handling complex renewal logic, dunning management, and automated customer communications. Processes 5K+ subscriptions daily.

**Investment:** $15,000-35,000
