# Custom Shopify App Development

Build the exact functionality your business needs. No compromises. No workarounds. No monthly app fees.

When existing Shopify apps don't solve your problem—or cost $500/month for features you barely use—a custom app might be your answer.

We build private apps for your store's unique workflows and public apps for the Shopify App Store.

WHO THIS IS FOR
============================================================

## Should You Build a Custom Shopify App?

Custom apps aren't always the answer. Here's when they make sense.

### You Should Build a Custom App If:

**You're Spending $500+/Month on Apps**
If you're paying multiple apps for overlapping features or paying for features you don't use, a custom app can pay for itself in 18-24 months.

**Existing Apps Don't Solve Your Problem**
You've tested 10+ apps and none do what you need. You're forced to use workarounds or manual processes that waste hours every week.

**You Need Complex Integrations**
Connect Shopify to your ERP, WMS, custom CRM, or proprietary systems. Existing integration apps are too rigid or don't support your specific workflow.

**Your Business Logic Is Unique**
Custom pricing rules, complex inventory allocation, specialized fulfillment workflows, unique customer segmentation—logic that no generic app can handle.

**You Want to Own the Code**
No more worrying about apps shutting down, raising prices, or changing features. You own the codebase and control your destiny.

**You Hit App Limitations**
Performance bottlenecks, feature restrictions, or apps breaking with theme updates. Custom apps give you complete control.

### You Should Use Existing Apps If:

- Commodity functionality (email marketing, reviews, live chat)
- You need features quickly (custom apps take 2-4 months)
- Your budget is under $15K
- The app ecosystem has mature, reliable solutions
- You don't have technical resources for maintenance

CASE STUDY
============================================================

## Real Results: Furniture Retailer Custom App

A made-to-order furniture brand was spending $900/month on 4 different apps (product customizer, custom pricing, inventory management, and fulfillment) but still needed 8+ hours of manual work weekly.

### The Challenge
- Multiple apps with overlapping features
- Manual order processing for custom furniture
- Complex pricing based on materials, dimensions, and finishing
- No way to track production status
- Orders getting stuck between apps
- Apps kept breaking with theme updates

### The Solution
Built a single custom app that:
- Allows customers to configure furniture (wood, fabric, dimensions)
- Calculates pricing automatically based on materials and labor
- Integrates with their manufacturing system
- Tracks order through production stages
- Sends automated updates to customers

### The Results
- Eliminated $900/month in app fees ($10,800 annual savings)
- Saved 8 hours/week of manual work (~$15,000 annual labor savings)
- Configuration errors reduced from 15%+ to <1%
- Average order value increased 28% (better upsells during configuration)
- Customer satisfaction improved (real-time production updates)

**Total annual benefit:** $25,800 in savings + increased revenue

**ROI:** App paid for itself in 8 months

*"We should have built this 2 years ago. The app subscriptions were bleeding us dry, and we still had manual work. Now everything's automated."* - Operations Manager

FAQ
============================================================

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long does it take to build a custom app?**
Simple apps: 2-3 months. Medium complexity: 3-4 months. Complex apps: 4-6 months. Timeline depends on scope, integrations, and your responsiveness during the project.

**Do I own the code?**
Yes, completely. You receive all source code, documentation, and deployment instructions. You can host it yourself, hire another developer to maintain it, or work with us ongoing.

**What if the app breaks?**
We include 30 days post-launch support for bug fixes. After that, you can hire us on retainer ($1-4K/month) or handle maintenance yourself. We document everything clearly.

**Can you maintain apps built by other developers?**
Often yes, if the code is well-documented. We'll review the codebase first to assess if we can work with it effectively.

**How much does hosting cost?**
Typically $200-500/month depending on traffic and database usage. We can deploy to Vercel, Railway, AWS, or your preferred platform.

**What happens if Shopify changes their API?**
Shopify API changes are rare and usually backward-compatible. If breaking changes occur, we can update your app. This is why many clients opt for maintenance retainers.

**Can you integrate with any third-party system?**
If it has an API, we can integrate with it. If no API exists, we can often scrape data or find workarounds, though this is less reliable.

**Do you sign NDAs?**
Yes, we're happy to sign mutual NDAs before discussing your specific business logic and requirements.

**What if we want to add features later?**
Easy. We can add features on a project basis or through ongoing retainer. Clean code means features are addable without rebuilding from scratch.

**Can you help us decide between custom vs. existing apps?**
Absolutely. We'll honestly tell you if existing apps are a better solution. We've turned down projects where apps made more sense.
