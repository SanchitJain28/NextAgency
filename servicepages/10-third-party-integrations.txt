# Shopify Third-Party Integrations

Connect Shopify to your business ecosystem. Seamless data flow between systems.

Your business runs on multiple platforms—ERP, WMS, CRM, accounting software, fulfillment systems. When these systems don't talk to each other, you're stuck with manual data entry, errors, and inefficiency.

We build robust integrations that sync data automatically and reliably.

**Trusted by brands tired of manual data entry and disconnected systems**


============================================================
WHO THIS IS FOR
============================================================

## Do You Need a Third-Party Integration?

Integrations make sense when manual processes are costing you time and money.

### You Need Integration If:

**You're Doing Manual Data Entry**
Copying orders from Shopify to your ERP. Updating inventory across multiple systems. Manually importing customer data. Even 30 minutes daily = 180 hours/year wasted.

**Data Is Out of Sync**
Inventory shows available in Shopify but it's out of stock in your warehouse. Customer data in Shopify doesn't match your CRM. Orders processed but accounting isn't updated.

**You're Scaling and Hitting Limits**
Processing 50+ orders daily makes manual workflows unsustainable. You're hiring people just to move data between systems.

**You Need Real-Time Data**
Instant inventory updates when orders are fulfilled. Real-time customer data for personalization. Immediate order sync to fulfillment systems.

**You Have Complex Business Logic**
Custom pricing rules in your ERP need to sync to Shopify. Inventory allocation across multiple warehouses. Order routing based on product type or location.

**Compliance or Audit Requirements**
Need unified customer data for GDPR compliance. Require complete order trails across systems. Need real-time financial data for audits.

### You Can Wait If:

- Processing under 20 orders daily
- Manual processes take under 2 hours/week
- Your systems have built-in integrations that work
- Budget under $15K
- You're still figuring out your tech stack

CASE STUDY
============================================================

## Real Results: D2C Beauty Brand ERP Integration

A rapidly growing beauty brand was manually entering 150+ orders daily from Shopify into their ERP system. Inventory was out of sync, causing overselling and customer complaints.

### The Challenge
- 3 people spending 4 hours/day on manual data entry (12 person-hours daily)
- Inventory sync happening once daily, causing overselling
- Order entry errors causing fulfillment delays
- No real-time visibility into actual inventory
- Customer data disconnected between systems
- Financial reporting delayed by manual reconciliation

### The Solution
Built a bidirectional integration between Shopify and their ERP:
- Orders: Automatically pushed to ERP every 5 minutes
- Inventory: Real-time sync (15-minute intervals)
- Products: New products from ERP sync to Shopify automatically
- Customers: Customer master data synchronized
- Fulfillment: Tracking numbers flow back to Shopify
- Pricing: Special pricing rules from ERP enforced in Shopify

### The Results
- Time Saved: 12 person-hours/day eliminated = 60 hours/week = 3,120 hours/year
- Labor Cost Savings: $75,000/year (3 people freed up for growth work)
- Overselling Eliminated: Inventory accuracy improved from 75% to 99.2%
- Order Processing Speed: Orders reach fulfillment in 5 minutes vs. 8 hours
- Error Reduction: Order entry errors reduced from 8% to <0.1%
- Revenue Impact: Reduced stockouts increased revenue by $120K annually
- Financial Reporting: Month-end close reduced from 5 days to 1 day

**Total Annual Benefit:** $195K ($75K labor savings + $120K revenue increase)

**ROI:** Integration paid for itself in 4 months

FAQ
============================================================

**How long does an integration take?**
Simple integrations: 5-8 weeks. Standard: 8-12 weeks. Complex: 12-20 weeks. Timeline depends on systems involved, API quality, and complexity.

**Can you integrate with any system?**
If it has an API, we can integrate with it. If no API exists, we can sometimes scrape data or find workarounds, though this is less reliable.

**What if the third-party system has poor documentation?**
We've dealt with this many times. We reverse-engineer APIs, contact vendors for support, and find creative solutions. It takes longer but is usually possible.

**Will the integration break if systems update?**
Well-built integrations handle minor API changes. Major breaking changes (rare) may require updates. This is why many clients opt for maintenance retainers.

**Can we modify the integration later?**
Yes. We document everything clearly and can add features or modify logic as your business evolves.

**What happens if the integration fails?**
We build error handling, retry logic, and alerting into every integration. You'll be notified immediately if something fails, and we can fix it quickly.

**Do you provide training?**
Yes. We train your team on the admin dashboard, how to monitor the integration, and how to handle common issues.

**Can we see the code?**
Yes, you own all the code. We provide complete source code and documentation.
