WHY BUILD A MOBILE APP
============================================================

## When Mobile Apps Make Sense

### You Should Build a Mobile App If:

**High Mobile Traffic**
If 70%+ of your traffic is mobile and you process 500+ orders monthly, an app can significantly improve mobile conversion.

**Repeat Purchase Business**
Subscription boxes, consumables, beauty products, supplements—businesses with repeat customers benefit most from apps.

**Strong Brand Loyalty**
Customers love your brand and would download an app. Apps work best when customers want to engage regularly.

**Push Notification Value**
You have restock alerts, personalized promotions, or time-sensitive offers where push notifications drive sales.

**Premium Positioning**
Luxury and premium brands where an app enhances brand perception and provides elevated experience.

### Apps May Not Make Sense If:

- Low repeat purchase rate (one-time purchases)
- Revenue under $1M annually
- Limited mobile traffic (<60%)
- Customers unlikely to download app
- Budget under $40K

NATIVE vs HYBRID APPS
============================================================

## Why We Build Native Apps

**Native Apps (Our Approach)**
- Built specifically for iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin)
- Best performance
- Full access to device features
- Best UX
- More expensive initially

**Hybrid Apps (Flutter/React Native)**
- Single codebase for both platforms
- Good performance (but not native-level)
- Some device feature limitations
- Lower cost
- Faster development

**Our Recommendation:** For e-commerce, native apps provide the premium experience that converts. The investment difference is worth it for serious brands.
