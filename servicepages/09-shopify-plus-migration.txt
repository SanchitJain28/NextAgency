WHEN TO UPGRADE TO SHOPIFY PLUS
============================================================

## Is Shopify Plus Right for Your Business?

Shopify Plus costs $2,000-2,300/month. Here's when it makes sense.

### You Should Upgrade If:

**You're Doing $5M+ Annual Revenue**
At this scale, the 0.15% transaction fee reduction alone often covers part of the Plus subscription. Plus, you need enterprise features to operate efficiently.

**You Need Advanced Checkout Customization**
Want to add custom fields, modify checkout layout, create one-page checkout, or add post-purchase upsells? Plus unlocks checkout extensibility.

**You Have Multiple Sales Channels**
Running B2B, wholesale, retail, and DTC on different platforms? Shopify Plus lets you manage everything from one admin with custom pricing by channel.

**You're Managing 50+ Staff Accounts**
Standard Shopify limits staff accounts (5 on Advanced plan). Plus offers unlimited staff with granular permissions—critical for large teams.

**You Need Automation at Scale**
Shopify Flow (Plus-exclusive) automates hundreds of workflows: fraud detection, inventory alerts, customer tagging, order routing, and more.

**International Expansion**
Launching in multiple countries? Plus gives you 10 expansion stores at $250/month each, multi-currency, and localized experiences.

**You're Hitting API Rate Limits**
Standard Shopify has strict API rate limits. Plus provides 4x higher limits—essential if you're running custom apps or heavy integrations.

**Your Brand Demands Premium Support**
Plus includes dedicated merchant success manager, 24/7 priority support, and access to Plus Partner ecosystem.

### You Should Wait If:

- Revenue under $3M annually (ROI unclear)
- Standard Shopify features meet all your needs
- You don't need B2B/wholesale capabilities
- Staff account limits aren't an issue
- Budget is a primary constraint
