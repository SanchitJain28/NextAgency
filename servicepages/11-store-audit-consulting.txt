WHO THIS IS FOR
============================================================

## Do You Need a Store Audit?

### You Should Get an Audit If:

**Your Traffic Is Good But Sales Are Low**
Getting visitors but not converting? Something's wrong with UX, trust signals, or checkout flow. An audit reveals exactly what's breaking the conversion path.

**You've Hit a Revenue Plateau**
Revenue stuck at the same level for 6+ months? An audit identifies optimization opportunities you haven't considered.

**Site Speed Is Slow**
Long load times kill conversions. If your store takes 5+ seconds to load, you're losing 40%+ of visitors before they see anything.

**You're Not Sure What to Fix Next**
Limited budget and time. Should you fix mobile experience? Improve checkout? Add reviews? An audit prioritizes what will actually move the needle.

**Before Major Investment**
Planning a theme redesign, app implementation, or marketing push? Audit first to ensure you're building on solid foundations.

**Post-Migration or Redesign**
Just migrated to Shopify or launched a redesign? Audit helps catch issues before they compound.

**SEO Rankings Dropped**
Lost organic traffic? Technical SEO issues might be the culprit. An audit identifies and fixes the problems.

### You Can Wait If:

- Store is brand new (under 3 months old)
- You're still figuring out product-market fit
- Monthly traffic under 5,000 visitors
- Revenue under ₹5 lakh/month
- Major redesign already planned and budgeted


============================================================
OUR AUDIT PROCESS
============================================================

## 8-Area Comprehensive Audit

We audit every critical aspect of your Shopify store and provide actionable recommendations.

### 1. Performance & Speed Audit

**What We Analyze:**
- Page load times (desktop and mobile)

**Example Finding:**
