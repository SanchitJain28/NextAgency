# Shopify Theme Customization

Make your Shopify store uniquely yours. Custom themes that match your brand perfectly.

Pre-built themes are a starting point, not the finish line. Whether you need extensive modifications to an existing theme or a completely custom theme from scratch, we build Shopify themes that feel premium and perform beautifully.

WHO THIS IS FOR
============================================================

## Do You Need Theme Customization?

### You Should Get Theme Customization If:

**Your Theme Feels Generic**
Every brand using the same theme looks similar. Custom modifications make your store distinctive and aligned with your brand identity.

**You Need Features Your Theme Doesn't Have**
Want custom product displays, unique filtering, specialized cart functionality, or features your theme doesn't support natively?

**Your Brand Has Specific Design Requirements**
Premium brands need premium design. Off-the-shelf themes can't always match sophisticated brand guidelines.

**You're Launching a New Store**
Starting fresh? A custom theme ensures your store launches with exactly the features and design you need.

**Your Current Theme Is Slow or Buggy**
Legacy themes with bloated code, poor performance, or constant bugs need replacement or major refactoring.

### Theme Customization vs. Headless

- **Theme Customization:** $12-60K, faster to market, easier to maintain
- **Headless Commerce:** $50-200K, complete creative freedom, requires technical resources

If you need unique design but don't need complete creative control, theme customization is more cost-effective.

WHAT WE OFFER
============================================================

## Theme Customization Services
