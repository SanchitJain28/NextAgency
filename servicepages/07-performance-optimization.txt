# Shopify Performance Optimization

Make your store lightning fast. Every second counts.

A 1-second delay in page load decreases conversions by 7%. If your store loads in 5 seconds instead of 2, you're losing 21% of potential sales.

We optimize Shopify stores to load in under 2 seconds.

WHY SPEED MATTERS
============================================================

## The Cost of Slow Stores

**Conversion Impact**
- 1-second delay = 7% conversion decrease
- 5-second load vs. 2-second = 21% fewer sales
- Mobile users especially sensitive to speed

**SEO Impact**
- Google ranks faster sites higher
- Core Web Vitals are ranking factors
- Slow sites lose organic traffic

**User Experience**
- 53% mobile users abandon sites taking 3+ seconds
- Slow sites feel unprofessional
- Speed affects brand perception

**Real Example:** A store doing $50K monthly revenue with 3% conversion and 5-second load time. Optimizing to 2 seconds could add $10.5K monthly revenue (21% conversion boost).
