# Headless Shopify Development

Break free from theme limitations. Build the premium digital experience your brand deserves.

Headless commerce separates your storefront (what customers see) from your backend (Shopify's commerce engine). This gives you complete creative freedom while keeping Shopify's operational reliability.

Build editorial experiences. Create unique interactions. Deliver sub-second page loads. All while Shopify handles products, checkout, and orders.

WHO THIS IS FOR
============================================================

## Is Headless Right for Your Brand?

Headless commerce is not for everyone. It's a significant investment that makes sense in specific situations.

### You Should Consider Headless If:

**Your Brand Identity Demands It**
Premium fashion, luxury goods, design-led brands—if your brand positioning requires a distinctive digital experience that themes cannot deliver, headless is the answer.

**Visual Storytelling Is Your Competitive Edge**
Editorial layouts, lookbook experiences, scroll-based narratives, immersive product presentations—these require custom frontend development.

**You're Scaling Beyond $5M Annual Revenue**
The investment in headless ($50-150K+) requires sufficient revenue to justify the cost. Below $5M annually, optimize your existing theme instead.

**Mobile Experience Is Critical**
If 80%+ of your traffic is mobile and you need app-like performance, headless delivers sub-second page transitions that themes cannot match.

**You Need Advanced Integrations**
Complex personalization, AR/VR experiences, custom configurators, ERP integrations—headless provides the flexibility to build these seamlessly.

### You Should Wait If:

- You're still finding product-market fit
- Your revenue is under $5M annually
- Standard theme functionality meets your needs
- You lack technical resources for ongoing maintenance
- Speed to market is more important than uniqueness

============================================================
FAQ
============================================================

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long does a headless build take?**
Standard builds take 5-7 months from kickoff to launch. Premium builds take 6-9 months. Timeline depends on complexity, integrations, and content readiness. We provide detailed timeline during discovery.

**Can I use my existing Shopify store?**
Yes. Headless keeps your existing Shopify backend (products, orders, customers, checkout). We just rebuild the customer-facing frontend. Your Shopify admin stays the same.

**What happens to my existing theme?**
The headless frontend replaces your theme. However, Shopify checkout still uses your theme temporarily (until Checkout Extensibility is fully rolled out). We ensure visual consistency.

**How much do hosting costs add?**
Hosting a Next.js headless store on Vercel or Netlify typically costs $500-1,000/month depending on traffic. This is separate from the development cost and Shopify plan fees.

**Can my team manage content after launch?**
Yes. We set up a visual CMS (Sanity or Contentful) so your marketing team can update content, create campaign pages, and manage editorial sections without code.

**Is headless harder to maintain?**
Headless requires technical maintenance (updates, API changes, bug fixes). We offer maintenance retainers, or you can hire developers. It's more technical than theme stores but more flexible.

**What about SEO?**
Server-side rendering in Next.js means excellent SEO. Often better than theme stores because of faster load times and cleaner HTML. We implement all technical SEO best practices.

**Can I add features later?**
Yes. One advantage of headless is flexibility. Want to add AR try-on? Custom quiz? Advanced personalization? We can add features without rebuilding the entire store.

**Do you offer payment plans?**
We structure payments in milestones: 25% on signing, 25% after design approval, 25% mid-development, 25% on launch. Custom payment schedules possible for enterprise clients.

**What if I'm not happy with the design?**
We include revision rounds at each phase. If designs don't meet expectations, we revise until they do. We've never launched a project where the client wasn't happy with the final result.
