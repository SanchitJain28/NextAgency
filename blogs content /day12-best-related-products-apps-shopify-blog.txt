# 5 Best Related Products Apps for Shopify in 2025

Your theme's default "Related Products" section is costing you sales.

Here is what it actually does: it pulls random products from the same collection. A customer viewing a blue denim jacket sees a red cocktail dress as a "related product" because both happen to be in your "Women's Clothing" collection.

That is not related. That is random.

True related products help customers find what they are actually looking for—similar styles, complementary items, or alternatives in different colors. When done right, related products increase time on site, reduce bounce rates, and lift average order value by 10-30%.

The problem is that Shopify's native functionality is limited. Its built-in recommendations use basic collection matching or require purchase history data that new stores do not have. For most stores, you need a dedicated app to show genuinely relevant product suggestions.

We tested the most popular related products apps on the Shopify App Store. This guide covers the 5 best options—from AI-powered automatic matching to fully manual control—so you can choose the right one for your store.


## Quick Comparison

| App | Best For | Pricing | Automation Level | Unique Strength |
|-----|----------|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| AI Related Products by Scalefront | Automatic setup | Free tier available | Fully AI-powered | Zero manual configuration |
| Tipo Related Products | Manual control | Free tier, then $7.99+/mo | Manual + rule-based | Handpicked recommendations |
| Cross Sell & Upsell by SSC | Multiple placements | Free tier, then $29.99+/mo | AI + manual | 8 strategic locations |
| Recomatic Related Products | Data-driven accuracy | $79/mo | Algorithm-based | Sales data integration |
| Related Products – Relatify | Budget-friendly | $3.99-$59.99/mo | Tag/collection-based | Design customization |


## What Makes a Good Related Products App?

Before diving into the apps, let us establish what actually matters:

### Recommendation Relevance

Does the app show products that genuinely relate to what the customer is viewing? A customer looking at running shoes should see other running shoes, running socks, or fitness accessories—not sandals or dress shoes that happen to share a collection.

### Setup Requirements

Some apps require you to manually configure related products for every item. Others work automatically based on rules or AI. If you have 100+ products, manual setup becomes impractical.

### Display Options

Where can you show related products? Product pages are standard, but some apps also support cart pages, collection pages, homepage, and even post-purchase pages.

### Design Flexibility

Can the widget match your store's aesthetic? Generic-looking recommendation sections stand out (in a bad way) on polished stores.

### Performance Impact

Every app adds code to your store. Poorly optimized apps slow down page loads, hurting conversions. The best apps load asynchronously without affecting performance.

Now, let us look at each app.


## 1. AI Related Products by Scalefront

**Best for:** Store owners who want intelligent recommendations without manual setup

**Rating:** 5.0 ★ | **Pricing:** Free tier available

### Overview

AI Related Products by Scalefront takes the opposite approach from most recommendation apps. Instead of requiring you to manually select related products for each item—or relying on basic collection/tag matching—it uses AI to analyze your entire product catalog and generate intelligent recommendations automatically.

The app reads your product titles, descriptions, categories, tags, variants, and pricing to understand what each product actually is. Then it identifies logical relationships: what products are truly similar, what items complement each other, and what alternatives customers might prefer.

The result is recommendations that make sense without you lifting a finger.

### How It Works

When you install the app, it syncs your product catalog and processes each item through its AI engine. The system creates a "product understanding" for every item—essentially a detailed profile of what the product is, who it is for, and how it relates to other products in your store.

For example, if you sell a "Men's Navy Blue Slim Fit Cotton Shirt," the AI understands:
- Category: Men's shirts, formal/smart casual
- Attributes: Navy blue, slim fit, cotton fabric
- Price tier: Mid-range
- Use case: Office wear, smart casual occasions

Based on this understanding, it automatically suggests:
- Similar products: Other slim fit shirts, other navy shirts, other cotton shirts
- Complementary items: Matching ties, formal trousers, leather belts
- Alternatives: Same shirt in different colors, similar styles from other brands

### The New Product Advantage

Here is what makes this app genuinely different: when you add new products, it automatically updates recommendations everywhere.

With most apps, adding a new product means:
1. Setting up recommendations for the new product
2. Going back to existing products and adding the new product to their recommendations

With AI Related Products, both happen automatically. Add a new navy shirt to your catalog, and it automatically appears as a related product on your other shirt pages—without manual intervention.

For stores that frequently add products, this alone saves hours of ongoing maintenance.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Matching:** Analyzes product data to generate intelligent recommendations automatically
- **Zero Configuration:** Works out of the box—no manual product selection required
- **Automatic New Product Sync:** New products are integrated into recommendations across your entire catalog
- **Multiple Widget Types:** Related products, bestsellers, new arrivals, recently viewed
- **Flexible Placement:** Product pages, cart, collections, homepage
- **One-Click Setup:** Install, sync, and recommendations are live within minutes

### Pricing

- Free tier with core features
- Paid plans for additional customization and support

### Pros

- Truly automatic—no manual configuration required
- AI understands product relationships (not just collection matching)
- New products automatically integrated
- Fast setup regardless of catalog size
- Lightweight, no performance impact

### Cons

- Newer app with growing review base
- Best results require good product data (detailed titles/descriptions)
- Advanced customization still being developed

### Best For

Store owners who do not want to spend hours manually configuring recommendations. Particularly valuable for stores with 100+ products where manual setup would take days, and for stores that frequently add new products.

## 2. Tipo Related Products

**Best for:** Stores wanting precise manual control over recommendations

**Rating:** 4.9 ★ (277+ reviews) | **Pricing:** Free tier available, then from $7.99/mo

### Overview

Tipo Related Products is built for merchants who want complete control over what products appear as recommendations. While it offers automatic matching based on tags, vendor, type, or collection, its strength is the manual recommendation feature that lets you handpick exactly which products to show together.

This makes Tipo ideal for stores where product relationships are nuanced and require human judgment—like auto parts (where specific parts fit specific vehicle models), electronics (where accessories must be compatible), or curated fashion (where you want to style complete outfits).

### How It Works

Tipo offers two approaches:

**Automatic Matching:** The app can display products that share the same collection, tags, vendor, or product type. This works for basic "similar products" displays but lacks intelligence—it is essentially rule-based matching.

**Manual Recommendations:** For each product, you can handpick specific items to appear as related products. This gives you complete control but requires setup time for each product.

Most merchants use a combination: automatic matching as a baseline, with manual overrides for key products where the automatic suggestions are not ideal.

### Key Features

- **Manual Recommendations:** Handpick specific products to recommend for any item
- **Automatic Matching:** Show products from same collection, tags, vendor, or type
- **Multiple Widget Types:** Frequently bought together, related products, bestsellers, new arrivals, trending items, recently viewed
- **Flexible Placement:** Product pages, cart page, checkout, thank you page
- **Automatic Discounts:** Offer percentage or fixed discounts when customers add recommended products
- **Built for Shopify Badge:** Meets Shopify's quality and performance standards

### Pricing

- Free tier for basic features
- Premium plans from approximately $7.99/month

### Pros

- Excellent manual control for precise recommendations
- "Built for Shopify" certification
- Clean widget designs with customization options
- Checkout and thank you page placements included
- Highly responsive support team

### Cons

- Manual setup required for best results (time-consuming for large catalogs)
- No true AI recommendation engine
- Automatic mode is basic (rule-based matching only)
- Limited analytics and reporting

### Best For

Stores where product relationships require human judgment—auto parts, technical equipment, curated fashion, specialty items. If you know exactly which products should be recommended together and want complete control, Tipo delivers.

## 3. Cross Sell & Upsell by SSC

**Best for:** Stores wanting recommendations across multiple touchpoints

**Rating:** 4.9 ★ (960+ reviews) | **Pricing:** Free tier available, then from $29.99/mo

### Overview

Cross Sell & Upsell by SSC stands out for its placement flexibility. While most related products apps focus on product pages, SSC offers 8 strategic locations throughout your store: product pages, cart pages, cart popups, post-purchase pages, checkout pages, home pages, collection pages, and custom locations.

The app combines manual product selection with AI-powered smart suggestions, giving you control while reducing setup time. It has been around for years with nearly 1,000 reviews, making it a battle-tested option.

### How It Works

You can set up cross-sell and related product recommendations in two ways:

**Manual Selection:** Choose specific products to recommend for each item. The app makes this efficient with bulk editing tools and a backup feature that shows automatic suggestions for products without manual configuration.

**Smart Suggestions:** The AI analyzes your sales history, order patterns, and product data to automatically suggest relevant products. This works well for stores with established purchase history.

The multi-location approach means you can catch customers at different points in their journey—browsing products, viewing their cart, during checkout, or after purchase.

### Key Features

- **8 Strategic Locations:** Product page, cart, popup, post-purchase, checkout, home, collections, custom pages
- **Manual + AI Recommendations:** Choose products yourself or use smart suggestions
- **Backup Cross-Sells:** Automatic fallback for products without manual configuration
- **QuickView Buttons:** Let customers preview products without leaving the page
- **Quantity Discount Bundles:** Offer discounts for purchasing multiple items
- **Fully Customizable:** Match your brand's look and feel

### Pricing

- Free: 50 recommendation clicks/month, limited placements
- Startup ($29.99/mo): 2,500 clicks, branding removed
- Small Store ($49.99/mo): 5,000 clicks, all pages
- Medium Store ($59.99/mo): 10,000 clicks, custom pages

Note: Pricing is click-based, which can be cost-effective for smaller stores but expensive at scale.

### Pros

- Most placement options of any app (8 locations)
- Combines manual control with AI suggestions
- Years of development and optimization
- Strong integration with page builders (PageFly, Shogun, GemPages)
- Responsive customer support

### Cons

- Click-based pricing can get expensive at scale
- Interface can feel overwhelming with many options
- Some users report slow support response times
- Requires configuration for best results

### Best For

Stores wanting to display related products across multiple touchpoints—not just product pages. Particularly effective for stores with lower traffic (where click-based pricing works) or those using page builder apps for custom layouts.

## 4. Recomatic Related Products

**Best for:** Data-driven stores wanting the most accurate recommendations

**Rating:** 5.0 ★ (170+ reviews) | **Pricing:** $79/mo (Shopify Plus: $299/mo)

### Overview

Recomatic takes a data-driven approach to related products. It combines your sales history with dozens of product attributes to generate recommendations that are genuinely relevant—not just based on collections or tags.

The app has maintained a perfect 5-star rating across 170+ reviews, which is remarkable for a premium-priced app. Users consistently praise its recommendation accuracy and the responsiveness of Daniel, who handles customer support personally.

### How It Works

Recomatic's algorithm analyzes:
- **Sales Data:** What products are actually purchased together
- **Product Attributes:** Title, description, type, tags, price range, vendor
- **Customer Behavior:** Browsing patterns and purchase history
- **Conversion Data:** Which recommendations actually lead to sales

The system continuously learns and improves. As you get more sales data, recommendations become more accurate. This makes Recomatic particularly powerful for established stores with purchase history.

For new stores, the app still works—it relies more heavily on product attributes initially and incorporates sales data as it accumulates.

### Key Features

- **Smart Algorithm:** Combines sales data with dozens of attributes for accurate matching
- **Conversion Tracking:** Built-in analytics showing which recommendations drive sales
- **Theme Editor Integration:** Add sections directly from Shopify's theme editor
- **Manual Fine-Tuning:** Override automatic suggestions with handpicked products
- **Asynchronous Loading:** Zero impact on page load speed
- **Multi-Store Support:** Dedicated support for merchants with multiple stores

### Pricing

- Recomatic: $79/month
- Recomatic Plus (Shopify Plus): $299/month

No free tier, but includes a 14-day free trial.

### Pros

- Perfect 5-star rating—users genuinely love it
- Most accurate recommendations (data-driven)
- Excellent conversion tracking and reporting
- Zero page speed impact
- Outstanding personal support (Daniel is consistently praised)
- Mature, battle-tested product

### Cons

- High price point ($79/mo) with no budget tier
- Shopify Plus pricing is very expensive ($299/mo)
- Best performance requires existing sales data
- Only focuses on related products (not a full upsell suite)

### Best For

Established stores with sales history wanting the most accurate possible recommendations. Recomatic is premium-priced but delivers premium results. If recommendation accuracy directly impacts your revenue (which it does), the $79/month often pays for itself many times over.

## 5. Related Products – Relatify

**Best for:** Budget-conscious stores wanting design flexibility

**Rating:** 4.9 ★ (100+ reviews) | **Pricing:** $3.99-$59.99/mo

### Overview

Relatify is a straightforward, budget-friendly option for displaying related products. It focuses on what most stores actually need: showing similar products based on tags, collections, vendors, or product types, with extensive design customization to match your brand.

What Relatify lacks in AI sophistication, it makes up for in design flexibility and pricing accessibility. You can customize nearly every visual aspect—fonts, colors, layouts, number of products—to create a recommendation section that feels native to your store.

### How It Works

Relatify uses rule-based matching:
- **By Collection:** Show products from the same collection
- **By Tags:** Match products sharing common tags
- **By Type:** Display products of the same type
- **By Vendor:** Show other products from the same brand/vendor

The app checks the current product's attributes and fetches related items based on your configured rules. It is not intelligent matching—it is logical matching based on your product organization.

Beyond related products, Relatify also offers widgets for new arrivals, trending products, hot products, and featured products. These can be placed on product pages, collection pages, homepage, blog pages, and cart pages.

### Key Features

- **Multiple Matching Rules:** Collections, tags, type, vendor
- **Additional Widgets:** New arrivals, trending, hot products, featured products
- **Extensive Customization:** Layout, fonts, colors, number of products per row
- **Multiple Placements:** Product, collection, home, blog, cart pages
- **Slider and Grid Options:** Choose display format per widget
- **Mobile Responsive:** Adjusts properly on all devices

### Pricing

- Starter: $3.99/month
- Basic: $9.99/month
- Premium: $29.99/month
- Advanced: $59.99/month

All plans include core functionality; higher tiers unlock additional customization and features.

### Pros

- Most affordable option in this comparison
- Excellent design customization
- Simple, straightforward functionality
- Responsive support team (Zooomy developers)
- Works reliably without complexity

### Cons

- No AI or intelligent matching
- Relies entirely on your product organization (tags, collections)
- Limited analytics and conversion tracking
- Less sophisticated than premium options
- Requires well-organized product data to work well

### Best For

Budget-conscious stores that have well-organized product data (proper tags, collections, types) and want a simple, customizable related products section. Relatify does the basics well at an accessible price point.

## How to Choose the Right App

Each app serves different needs. Here is how to decide:

### Choose AI Related Products by Scalefront if:
- You want automatic setup without manual configuration
- You have 100+ products and cannot spend days on setup
- You frequently add new products to your catalog
- You want AI that understands product relationships
- Budget is a concern (free tier available)

### Choose Tipo Related Products if:
- You want complete manual control over recommendations
- Your products have nuanced relationships requiring human judgment
- You need checkout and thank you page placements
- You prefer rule-based logic you can understand and control
- You have time to configure recommendations properly

### Choose Cross Sell & Upsell by SSC if:
- You want recommendations in multiple locations (8 placements)
- You use page builders like PageFly or Shogun
- You want both manual control and AI suggestions
- Your traffic is moderate (click-based pricing works for you)
- You need post-purchase and checkout recommendations

### Choose Recomatic Related Products if:
- You want the most accurate recommendations possible

- Budget is not a primary concern ($79/mo)
- You value conversion tracking and analytics
- You appreciate premium, personal support

### Choose Related Products – Relatify if:
- Budget is your primary concern ($3.99/mo starting)
- Your products are well-organized with proper tags/collections
- You prioritize design customization
- You need simple, reliable functionality
- You do not need AI-powered matching


## Implementation Tips

Whichever app you choose, follow these best practices:

### 1. Audit Your Product Data First

All recommendation apps work better with good product data. Before installing, review:
- Are your product titles descriptive and consistent?
- Do you have relevant tags on products?
- Are products in appropriate collections?
- Do descriptions include key attributes?

Clean product data leads to better recommendations—whether AI-powered or rule-based.

### 2. Start with Product Pages

Product pages are the highest-impact location for related products. Get this right before expanding to cart pages, homepage, or other locations. More placements is not always better—it can feel overwhelming.

### 3. Test Recommendation Relevance

After installation, browse your store as a customer would. Check 10-15 products and evaluate:
- Do the related products make sense?
- Would you actually want to see these suggestions?
- Are there any obviously wrong recommendations?

If recommendations are poor, either adjust configuration or try a different app.

### 4. Monitor Performance Impact

Check your PageSpeed score before and after installation. A significant drop indicates the app is slowing your store—contact support or consider alternatives.

### 5. Track Results

If your app offers conversion tracking, use it. Know which recommendations drive sales and which are ignored. If the app does not track conversions, use Google Analytics goals or Shopify's attribution to measure impact.

### 6. Iterate Based on Data

After 2-4 weeks, review what is working. Some products may need manual overrides. Some placements may underperform. Continuous refinement improves results over time.


## Conclusion

Your theme's default related products section is not good enough. It shows random products from collections rather than genuinely similar items—and that costs you sales.

The apps in this guide represent the best options for displaying truly related products in 2025:

- **AI Related Products by Scalefront** eliminates manual setup with intelligent AI matching
- **Tipo Related Products** gives you complete manual control for precise recommendations
- **Cross Sell & Upsell by SSC** offers the most placement locations (8 strategic spots)
- **Recomatic Related Products** delivers the most accurate data-driven recommendations
- **Related Products – Relatify** provides budget-friendly simplicity with design flexibility

The right choice depends on your priorities: automation vs. control, budget vs. features, simplicity vs. sophistication.

For most stores, we recommend starting with an automated solution (AI Related Products or Recomatic) to get baseline recommendations working quickly. You can always add manual overrides for specific products later.

If you need help selecting the right app or implementing product recommendations effectively, we offer store audits that identify your highest-impact opportunities.

FAQ SECTION (Add FAQPage Schema)
============================================================

Q: What is the best free related products app for Shopify?
A: AI Related Products by Scalefront offers a functional free tier with AI-powered recommendations. Tipo Related Products and Cross Sell by SSC also have free tiers, though with limitations. Relatify starts at just $3.99/month if you need slightly more features.

Q: How do related products increase sales?
A: Related products help customers discover items they might want, increasing both conversion rates and average order value. Studies show personalized recommendations can boost revenue by 10-30%. They also reduce bounce rates by giving customers more relevant options to explore.

Q: Do related products apps slow down Shopify stores?
A: Well-coded apps use asynchronous loading and should not impact page speed. All apps in this guide are optimized for performance. Always check your PageSpeed score before and after installation to verify.

Q: What is the difference between related products and cross-sell?
A: Related products show similar items (other running shoes when viewing running shoes). Cross-sell shows complementary items (running socks when viewing running shoes). Most apps in this guide handle both, though the terminology varies.

Q: Should I use manual or automatic product recommendations?
A: It depends on your catalog size and product complexity. For stores with 100+ products, automatic recommendations save significant time. For stores with nuanced product relationships (like auto parts), manual control may be necessary. Many stores use automatic matching as a baseline with manual overrides for key products.
