# 9 Best Upsell & Cross-Sell Apps for Shopify in 2025

You are leaving money on the table.

That is not a scare tactic. It is math.

The average Shopify store converts 1-3% of visitors into buyers. Acquiring each of those customers cost you money—ads, content, SEO, influencer deals. Once they are ready to buy, why would you let them checkout with just one item when they might happily buy two or three?

Upselling and cross-selling are the fastest ways to increase revenue without increasing traffic. A 10% lift in average order value (AOV) flows directly to your bottom line.

But here is the problem: Shopify's native product recommendations are basic. They show "You may also like" based on collections or tags—not intelligent matching. And manually setting up recommendations for hundreds of products? Nobody has time for that.

That is where upsell and cross-sell apps come in.

We tested over 20 apps from the Shopify App Store. We installed them on test stores, evaluated their features, measured their impact on page speed, and assessed ease of use. This guide covers the 9 best options for different use cases and budgets.

Let us dive in.

## What to Look for in a Shopify Upsell App

Before we review each app, let us establish what actually matters:

**Recommendation Quality**
Does the app suggest products that make sense? A customer buying running shoes should see running socks, not kitchen appliances. The best apps use AI or purchase history to make intelligent matches.

**Setup Time**
Some apps require you to manually configure recommendations for every product. Others work automatically. If you have 50+ products, automatic setup saves hours.

**Placement Options**
Where can you show recommendations? Product pages, cart, checkout, post-purchase, homepage? More placement options mean more opportunities to increase AOV.

**Page Speed Impact**
Every app adds JavaScript to your store. Poorly optimized apps slow down your site, hurting conversions. We tested load times for each app.

**Pricing Structure**
Some apps charge flat monthly fees. Others take a percentage of upsell revenue. Others charge based on order volume. Understand the true cost at your scale.

**Design Customization**
Can the widgets match your brand? Generic-looking recommendations feel out of place on premium stores.

Now, let us look at the apps.


## 1. Solid AI Related Products

**Best for:** Store owners who want automatic setup without manual configuration

**Rating:** 5.0 ★ | **Pricing:** Free plan available

### Overview

Solid AI Related Products takes a different approach than most recommendation apps. Instead of requiring you to manually select upsells, cross-sells, and related products for each item in your catalog, it uses AI to analyze your product data and automatically generate intelligent recommendations.

The app reads your product titles, descriptions, categories, tags, and pricing to understand what each product is. Then it identifies logical relationships—what should be upsold, what complements each product, and what similar items customers might like.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Matching:** The app analyzes your entire catalog and automatically generates recommendations. No manual product selection required.

- **Automatic New Product Sync:** When you add new products, they automatically get recommendations AND appear in existing products' recommendation sections where relevant.

- **Multiple Widget Types:** Related products, bestsellers, new arrivals, recently viewed—all customizable.

- **Placement Flexibility:** Display on product pages, cart, collections, and homepage.

- **One-Click Setup:** Install, sync your catalog, and recommendations are live within minutes.

### Pricing

- Free plan available with core features
- Paid plans for additional customization and priority support

### Pros

- Zero manual configuration—works out of the box
- AI actually understands product relationships (not just category matching)
- New products automatically integrated
- Fast setup regardless of catalog size
- No impact on page speed

### Cons

- Newer app with smaller review base
- Advanced customization options still being developed
- Best results require good product data (detailed titles and descriptions)

### Best For

Store owners tired of manually configuring recommendations. Particularly valuable for stores with 100+ products where manual setup would take days. The automatic new product sync alone saves hours of ongoing maintenance.

## 2. Essential Upsell & Cross Sell

**Best for:** Budget-conscious stores wanting core upsell functionality

**Rating:** 4.9 ★ (800+ reviews) | **Pricing:** Free plan available

### Overview

Essential Upsell & Cross Sell is a straightforward, reliable app that covers the fundamentals well. It offers frequently bought together bundles, product page upsells, cart drawer cross-sells, and post-purchase offers—all the placements most stores need.

The app integrates smoothly with Shopify themes and does not require coding knowledge. Setup is intuitive, though you will need to manually configure which products to recommend for each item (or rely on basic automatic suggestions based on collections).

### Key Features

- **Frequently Bought Together:** Display product bundles with one-click add to cart.

- **Product Page Upsells:** Show related items directly on product pages.

- **Cart Drawer Cross-Sells:** Suggest add-ons when customers view their cart.

- **Post-Purchase Upsells:** Offer additional products after checkout completion.

- **Automatic Discounts:** Apply bundle discounts automatically to incentivize larger orders.

### Pricing

- Free plan with full features
- The app is genuinely free—no hidden tiers or revenue sharing

### Pros

- Completely free with no limitations
- Clean, professional widget designs
- Easy setup with drag-and-drop customization
- Responsive customer support (24/7 availability claimed)
- No page speed impact

### Cons

- Recommendations require manual setup for best results
- "Automatic" mode just pulls from same collection (not truly intelligent)
- Limited analytics compared to premium options
- No audience segmentation

### Best For

New stores or budget-conscious merchants who want solid upsell functionality without monthly fees. The free pricing makes it risk-free to test, and the features cover most basic use cases well.

## 3. Tipo Related Products

**Best for:** Stores wanting precise manual control over recommendations

**Rating:** 4.9 ★ (270+ reviews) | **Pricing:** Free plan available

### Overview

Tipo Related Products is built for merchants who want complete control over what products appear as recommendations. While it offers automatic matching based on tags, vendor, type, or collection, its strength is the manual recommendation feature that lets you handpick exactly which products to show together.

This makes Tipo ideal for stores where product relationships are nuanced—like auto parts (where specific parts fit specific vehicle models) or fashion (where you want to curate complete outfits).

### Key Features

- **Manual Recommendations:** Handpick specific products to recommend for any item.

- **Automatic Matching:** Show products from same collection, tags, vendor, or type.

- **Multiple Widget Types:** Frequently bought together, related products, bestsellers, new arrivals, trending items, recently viewed.

- **Flexible Placement:** Product pages, cart page, checkout, thank you page.

- **Automatic Discounts:** Offer percentage or fixed discounts when customers add recommended products.

### Pricing

- Free plan for basic features
- Premium plans starting around $7.99/month for advanced features

### Pros

- Excellent manual control for precise recommendations
- Clean widget designs with customization options
- Built for Shopify badge (meets Shopify's quality standards)
- Responsive support team (frequently praised in reviews)
- Checkout and thank you page placements included

### Cons

- Manual setup required for best results (time-consuming for large catalogs)
- No true AI recommendation engine
- Limited analytics and reporting
- Automatic mode is basic (collection/tag matching only)

### Best For

Stores where product relationships require human judgment—auto parts, technical equipment, curated fashion, specialty items. If you know exactly which products should be recommended together, Tipo gives you that control.

## 4. Wiser – AI Upsell & Cross Sell

**Best for:** Stores wanting a comprehensive all-in-one recommendation solution

### Overview

Wiser is one of the most feature-rich recommendation apps available. It combines AI-powered product suggestions with an extensive library of widget types—frequently bought together, related products, recently viewed, shop the look, post-purchase upsells, and more.

- Learning curve for advanced features

### Best For

Established stores wanting a single app for all recommendation needs. Wiser's depth makes it ideal for merchants who will invest time in optimization. Agencies managing multiple stores also benefit from its comprehensive feature set.

## 5. Selleasy – Upsell & Cross Sell

**Best for:** Stores focused on checkout and post-purchase upsells

**Rating:** 4.9 ★ (1,900+ reviews) | **Pricing:** Free plan, then from $8.99/month

### Overview

Selleasy has become one of the most popular upsell apps on Shopify, with nearly 2,000 reviews. It excels at high-conversion placements—frequently bought together bundles, cart upsells, and especially post-purchase one-click offers.

The app uses embedded widgets and checkout extensions (rather than popups), creating a seamless experience that feels native to your store. Setup is straightforward, and the support team is known for helping with customizations via Zoom calls.

### Key Features

- **Cart Upsells:** Suggestions within the cart drawer or cart page.

## 6. UpCart – Cart Drawer Cart Upsell

**Best for:** Stores wanting to optimize the cart experience specifically

**Rating:** 4.8 ★ (670+ reviews) | **Pricing:** Free plan, then from $29.99/month

### Overview

UpCart takes a different approach—instead of scattering recommendations across your store, it focuses on optimizing the cart drawer. The app replaces your default cart with a customizable slide-out drawer that includes upsells, free shipping bars, discount codes, and add-ons.

The cart drawer approach is effective because customers see upsell offers at the moment of highest purchase intent—when they are already committed to buying.

### Key Features

- **Custom Cart Drawer:** Beautiful slide-out cart with full customization.

- **In-Cart Upsells:** Product recommendations directly in the cart.

- **Free Shipping Bar:** Progress bar showing how much more to qualify for free shipping.

- **Sticky Cart Button:** Always-visible cart button to reduce abandonment.

- **Add-Ons Module:** Offer shipping insurance, gift wrapping, priority handling.

- **Announcement Bar:** Display promotions or updates within the cart.

- **Discount Code Box:** Let customers apply discounts without leaving the cart.

### Pricing

- Free development stores
- $29.99/month for 0-200 orders
- $34.99/month for 201-500 orders
- $54.99/month for 501-1000 orders

### Pros

- Dramatically improves cart UX and conversion
- Cart-focused approach is highly effective for AOV
- Beautiful designs that match any brand
- Free shipping bar is proven to increase order values
- Strong customization options

### Cons

- Higher starting price than competitors
- Only optimizes cart (not product pages or post-purchase)
- Some users report customer support delays
- Can conflict with existing cart functionality

### Best For

Stores where cart abandonment is a problem or where the current cart experience is suboptimal. UpCart works particularly well for stores with strong traffic that want to maximize conversion from existing visitors. The free shipping bar alone often pays for the app.

## 7. OptiMonk – Popups: Upsell & More

**Best for:** Stores wanting popup-based upsells with advanced targeting

**Rating:** 4.8 ★ (900+ reviews) | **Pricing:** Free plan, then from $39/month

### Overview

OptiMonk is primarily a popup builder, but it includes powerful upsell and cross-sell functionality. Unlike embedded widgets, OptiMonk uses targeted popups that appear based on customer behavior—exit intent, scroll depth, time on page, cart contents, and more.

The popup approach is more interruptive than embedded recommendations but can achieve higher conversion rates when used strategically. OptiMonk's strength is its targeting and personalization capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Upsell Popups:** Show product recommendations in attention-grabbing popups.

- **Exit-Intent Targeting:** Display offers when customers are about to leave.

- **Cart-Based Targeting:** Show specific products based on cart contents.

- **A/B Testing:** Test different offers, designs, and triggers.

- **Gamification:** Lucky wheel, scratch cards, and other interactive popups.

- **Email/SMS Capture:** Build lists alongside upselling.

- **300+ Templates:** Pre-designed popups for various use cases.

### Pricing

- Free plan with up to 15,000 pageviews/month
- $39/month for up to 30,000 pageviews (Essential)
- $99/month for up to 100,000 pageviews (Growth)
- $249/month for unlimited pageviews (Premium)

### Pros

- Advanced targeting and segmentation
- A/B testing built in
- Combines list building with upselling
- 300+ templates reduce design time
- Drag-and-drop editor is intuitive

### Cons

- Popups can annoy customers if overused
- Pageview-based pricing can get expensive
- Not embedded (feels less native than widget-based apps)
- Primarily a popup tool (upselling is secondary)

### Best For

Stores wanting to combine email capture with upselling, or those who want advanced behavioral targeting. OptiMonk works well for promotional campaigns and limited-time offers where attention-grabbing popups are appropriate. Less ideal for subtle, always-on recommendations.

## 8. LimeSpot Personalizer

**Best for:** Enterprise stores wanting advanced personalization

**Rating:** 4.8 ★ (1,500+ reviews) | **Pricing:** From $18/month

### Overview

LimeSpot is an AI-powered personalization platform that goes beyond basic recommendations. It creates personalized shopping experiences by segmenting visitors based on browsing history, purchase patterns, location, device, and more—then showing different content to different segments.

The app includes upsells, cross-sells, bundles, and "frequently bought together" widgets, but its real power is in personalization. Returning visitors see products tailored to their preferences. First-time visitors see bestsellers. High-value customers see premium products.

### Key Features

- **AI Recommendations:** Machine learning suggests relevant products.

- **Audience Segmentation:** Create segments based on behavior, history, location.

- **Dynamic Personalization:** Show different content to different visitor segments.

- **Bundle Builder:** Create product bundles with AI or manual selection.

- **Post-Purchase Upsells:** One-click offers after checkout.

- **Email/SMS Personalization:** Personalized product recommendations in emails.

- **A/B Testing:** Test different recommendation strategies.

- **Advanced Analytics:** Detailed reporting on performance and revenue attribution.

### Pricing

- LimeSpot Turbo: $6.99/month (basic features)
- LimeSpot Max: $50/month (full personalization)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing based on revenue

### Pros

- True AI personalization (not just rule-based)
- Segment-based recommendations are powerful
- Email/SMS integration extends personalization beyond your site
- Extensive A/B testing capabilities
- Dedicated account management on higher tiers

### Cons

- Can be expensive at scale (revenue-based pricing on enterprise)
- Steeper learning curve than simpler apps
- Some users report confusing pricing structure
- Overkill for small stores

### Best For

Established stores with significant traffic wanting to maximize revenue through personalization. LimeSpot shines when you have enough visitor data for its AI to learn patterns. Stores under $50K/month revenue may not see the full benefit.

## 9. Candy Rack – One Click Upsell

**Best for:** Stores wanting elegant popup upsells at add-to-cart

**Rating:** 4.9 ★ (250+ reviews) | **Pricing:** From $19.99/month

### Overview

Candy Rack displays upsell offers in a sleek popup that appears immediately after customers click "Add to Cart." This timing is strategic—the customer has already committed to purchasing, so they are receptive to relevant add-ons.

The popup design is clean and mobile-optimized, avoiding the intrusive feel of many popup-based solutions. Candy Rack also offers checkout and post-purchase placements for full-funnel coverage.

### Key Features

- Limited to specific trigger points
- Less comprehensive than all-in-one solutions

### Best For

Stores wanting a focused, well-executed upsell solution without complexity. Candy Rack does one thing well—popup upsells at key moments. The clean design works particularly well for premium brands where aesthetic matters.

## How to Choose the Right Upsell App

With nine solid options, how do you decide? Consider these factors:

### Your Catalog Size

- **Under 50 products:** Manual setup is manageable. Tipo or Essential give you control.
- **50-200 products:** Balance is key. Wiser or Selleasy offer automation with customization.
- **200+ products:** Automation is essential. Solid AI Related Products or LimeSpot save time.

### Your Technical Comfort Level

- **Non-technical:** Essential, Tipo, or Candy Rack are straightforward.
- **Comfortable with apps:** Wiser, Selleasy, or UpCart offer more features to configure.
- **Advanced:** LimeSpot or OptiMonk provide deep customization and segmentation.

### Your Budget

- **Free or minimal:** Essential Upsell (free), Solid AI (free tier), Tipo (free tier)
- **$10-30/month:** Wiser, Selleasy, Candy Rack
- **$50+/month:** LimeSpot, OptiMonk, UpCart at scale

### Your Priority

- **Ease of setup:** Solid AI Related Products (automatic), Essential (simple)
- **Manual control:** Tipo (handpicked recommendations)
- **All-in-one:** Wiser (comprehensive features)
- **Post-purchase:** Selleasy (excellent post-purchase flow)
- **Cart optimization:** UpCart (cart drawer focus)
- **Popups/targeting:** OptiMonk (behavioral triggers)
- **Personalization:** LimeSpot (segment-based)
- **Clean design:** Candy Rack (elegant popups)


## Implementation Best Practices

Whichever app you choose, follow these principles:

### Start Simple

Enable one type of recommendation first—frequently bought together or related products on product pages. Measure results before adding more placements. Too many offers overwhelm customers.

### Match Your Brand

Customize widget colors, fonts, and layouts to match your store design. Generic-looking recommendations feel like ads and convert poorly.

### Test Placements

Product page recommendations work differently than cart upsells. Test each placement individually to understand what works for your audience.

### Monitor Page Speed

After installing any app, check your PageSpeed score. If it drops significantly, contact support or consider alternatives. Speed impacts conversion more than recommendations do.

### Review Analytics

Track which products get recommended, which get clicked, and which convert. Double down on high-performing combinations.

### Avoid Over-Upselling

Showing recommendations everywhere (product page, cart, checkout, post-purchase) can feel pushy. Choose 2-3 strategic placements rather than enabling everything.


## Conclusion

Upselling and cross-selling are not optional for serious Shopify stores. The math is simple: increasing AOV by 10-20% often has a bigger revenue impact than increasing traffic by the same percentage—and it costs nothing in ad spend.

The apps in this guide represent the best options available in 2025, each with different strengths:

- **Solid AI Related Products** eliminates manual setup with AI-powered recommendations
- **Essential Upsell & Cross Sell** provides free, solid functionality for budget-conscious stores
- **Tipo Related Products** gives complete manual control for curated recommendations
- **Wiser** offers comprehensive features for stores wanting all-in-one capability
- **Selleasy** excels at post-purchase upsells with excellent conversion rates
- **UpCart** transforms your cart into an AOV-boosting machine
- **OptiMonk** provides advanced targeting for popup-based offers
- **LimeSpot** delivers enterprise-grade personalization for high-traffic stores
- **Candy Rack** offers elegant one-click upsells at add-to-cart moments

Start with one app, measure results, and optimize. Even a 5% lift in AOV compounds significantly over time.

FAQ SECTION (Add FAQPage Schema)
============================================================

Q: What is the best free upsell app for Shopify?
A: Essential Upsell & Cross Sell offers the most complete free experience with no hidden limitations. Solid AI Related Products and Tipo Related Products also have functional free tiers. For stores under 100 orders/month, Wiser and Selleasy are effectively free.

Q: How much can upsell apps increase average order value?
A: Results vary by store, but most merchants report 10-30% AOV increases with properly implemented upselling. Some case studies show 30%+ lifts. The key is relevant recommendations—random products convert poorly.

Q: Do upsell apps slow down Shopify stores?
A: Poorly coded apps can impact page speed. The apps in this guide are generally well-optimized. Always check your PageSpeed score before and after installation, and choose apps with "Built for Shopify" badges when possible.

Q: What is the difference between upselling and cross-selling?
A: Upselling encourages customers to buy a higher-tier version of what they are considering (e.g., premium vs. standard). Cross-selling suggests complementary products (e.g., a case for the phone they are buying). Both increase AOV but work differently.

Q: Should I use AI-powered or manual recommendations?
A: It depends on your catalog and resources. AI-powered apps (Solid AI, Wiser, LimeSpot) work best for large catalogs where manual setup is impractical. Manual apps (Tipo) work best when you have specific product relationships that require human judgment.
