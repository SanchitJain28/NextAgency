faqs:
  - question: "How long does a CRO audit take?"
    answer: "A comprehensive CRO audit takes 15-25 hours total: 2-4 hours for analytics setup, 3-5 hours for traffic analysis, 2-3 hours for funnel analysis, 3-4 hours for on-page review, 2-4 hours for qualitative feedback, and 2-3 hours for prioritization. Typically completed over 1-2 weeks to collect sufficient data. Professional agencies charge $3,000-15,000 for full audits."
  - question: "How often should I do a CRO audit?"
    answer: "Conduct full CRO audits every 6 months, mini-audits quarterly, and monitor key metrics weekly. Also audit when: launching new products, traffic increases but conversion drops, after major site redesign, before seasonal peaks, or if conversion plateaus for 3+ months."
  - question: "What tools do I need for a CRO audit?"
    answer: "Minimum required: Google Analytics 4 (free) for traffic/conversion data, heatmap tool like Hotjar ($39/month) or Microsoft Clarity (free) for behavior analysis, and page speed tool like Google PageSpeed Insights (free). Optional but helpful: A/B testing tool (Google Optimize free), user testing platform (UserTesting $49/test), survey tool (Hotjar included)."
  - question: "What's a good conversion rate for ecommerce?"
    answer: "Average ecommerce conversion rates: 2-3% overall, 1-2% for cold traffic (ads, social), 3-5% for warm traffic (organic search), 5-8% for hot traffic (email, retargeting). By device: Desktop 3-4%, Mobile 1-2%. Industry varies: Fashion 1-2%, Electronics 2-3%, Beauty 3-4%. Focus on improvement over time vs benchmarks."
  - question: "How much can a CRO audit improve conversion?"
    answer: "Typical improvements from CRO audits: 20-50% conversion increase over 6-12 months, 15-30% revenue increase, 10-20% average order value increase. Quick wins (form reduction, trust signals, speed optimization) often deliver 10-30% improvement within 4-8 weeks. Major changes (checkout redesign, mobile optimization) deliver 30-60% improvement over 3-6 months."
  - question: "Should I hire an agency for a CRO audit?"
    answer: "Hire agency if: annual revenue >$500K (ROI justifies cost), lack internal expertise, need objective external view, want comprehensive analysis with testing. DIY if: early stage (<$500K revenue), limited budget, have analytics expertise, want to learn process. Hybrid: DIY audit, hire for implementation and testing."
  - question: "What are the biggest CRO issues in ecommerce?"
    answer: "Top 10 issues from 100+ audits: (1) Mobile speed >3 seconds (85% of stores), (2) Missing product information (80%), (3) No trust signals (75%), (4) Too many form fields (70%), (5) Poor product images (65%), (6) Unclear value proposition (60%), (7) No reviews visible (55%), (8) No cart recovery emails (50%), (9) No exit-intent (45%), (10) Complex checkout (40%)."
  - question: "How do I prioritize CRO fixes?"
    answer: "Use ICE framework: Rate each issue 1-10 on Impact (conversion improvement), Confidence (certainty it will work), Ease (implementation difficulty). Calculate ICE score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3. Prioritize scores 8.0+ first (quick wins), then 6.0-7.9 (medium effort), then <6.0 (major projects). Focus on mobile, checkout, and product pages first."

Your store gets 10,000 visitors per month but only 200 sales.

That's a 2% conversion rate. Industry average is 2-3%, so you're "normal."

But what if you could get to 4%? That's 400 sales. Double your revenue with the same traffic.

**This is what a CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) audit does.**

It systematically identifies why visitors aren't converting and gives you a prioritized action plan to fix it.

![Analytics dashboard showing conversion metrics](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

Most store owners skip CRO audits and jump straight to random optimizations: "Let's change the button color!" or "Maybe we need a popup!"

**This is backwards.**

A proper [CRO audit](/services/store-audit-consulting) tells you exactly what's broken, why it's broken, and what to fix first for maximum impact.

Here's our 6-step framework for conducting a comprehensive ecommerce CRO audit that actually drives results.

## What Is an Ecommerce CRO Audit?

A CRO audit is a systematic analysis of your ecommerce site to identify:

1. **Where visitors drop off** (conversion funnel leaks)
2. **Why they drop off** (friction points, trust issues, confusion)
3. **What to fix first** (prioritized by impact and effort)

![Ecommerce audit checklist and planning](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454165804606-c3d57bc86b40?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**What it's NOT:**
- Random website critiques ("I don't like this color")
- Guessing what might work
- Following generic best practices without data
- One-time fixes (CRO is ongoing)

**What it IS:**
- Data-driven analysis
- User behavior insights
- Systematic identification of problems
- Prioritized action plan

**Typical findings from CRO audits:**
- Homepage doesn't pass 5-second test (visitors don't understand what you sell)
- Mobile checkout has 3x higher abandonment than desktop
- Product pages missing key information (size guides, shipping info)
- Site speed on mobile is 5+ seconds (losing 50% of visitors)
- No trust signals at critical decision points

Let's walk through how to conduct your own audit.

## Step 1: Set Up Proper Analytics & Tracking

**Time investment:** 2-4 hours
**Impact:** Foundation for all other steps

You can't audit what you can't measure.

Before analyzing anything, ensure you're tracking the right data.

![Data analytics and tracking setup](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

### What to Set Up

**1. Google Analytics 4 (GA4)**

Essential metrics to track:
- Traffic sources (where visitors come from)
- Bounce rate by page
- Average session duration
- Pages per session
- Conversion rate overall and by traffic source

**Key events to configure:**
```
- View product
- Add to cart
- Begin checkout
- Add payment info
- Purchase
- Newsletter signup
- Account creation
```

**2. Enhanced Ecommerce Tracking**

Track the full funnel:
- Product impressions
- Product clicks
- Add to cart
- Remove from cart
- Checkout steps
- Purchases

**3. Shopify Analytics (if using Shopify)**

Shopify's built-in analytics show:
- Sales by traffic source
- Sales by location
- Top products
- Returning customer rate
- Average order value (AOV)

**4. Heatmap & Session Recording Tools**

**Recommended tools:**
- **Hotjar** (heatmaps, recordings, surveys) - $39/month
- **Microsoft Clarity** (free, excellent recordings)
- **Lucky Orange** (heatmaps + live chat) - $10-50/month

**What to track:**
- Click heatmaps (where users click)
- Scroll maps (how far users scroll)
- Move maps (mouse movement patterns)
- Session recordings (actual user behavior)

**5. Form Analytics**

Track form interactions:
- Which fields users struggle with
- Where they abandon forms
- Time spent on each field
- Error messages triggered

**Tools:**
- Hotjar Form Analytics
- Google Analytics form tracking
- Zuko (form analytics specialist)

### Data Quality Checklist

Before proceeding, verify:

- [ ] GA4 is tracking all pages correctly
- [ ] Conversion events fire correctly (test with Tag Manager)
- [ ] E-commerce tracking shows revenue data
- [ ] Heatmaps have collected 1,000+ page views per critical page
- [ ] Session recordings are capturing mobile and desktop
- [ ] At least 30 days of data collected (60+ days ideal)

**Common setup mistakes:**

- Tracking code only on homepage
- Double-tracking (GA4 + Universal Analytics both active)
- Conversion events not configured
- Filters excluding important traffic
- Not tracking logged-in vs logged-out users

**If your data is incomplete, wait.**

Better to spend 2-4 weeks collecting proper data than make decisions on bad data.

## Step 2: Analyze Traffic & User Behavior

**Time investment:** 3-5 hours
**Impact:** Identifies where problems exist

Now that you're tracking data, analyze it to understand user behavior.

![User behavior analysis and customer journey](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553877522-43269d4ea984?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

### Traffic Analysis

**Key questions to answer:**

**1. Where do visitors come from?**

Check GA4 → Acquisition → Traffic acquisition

Typical breakdown:
- Organic search: 30-50%
- Direct: 20-30%
- Paid ads: 10-30%
- Social: 5-15%
- Email: 5-10%
- Referral: 5-10%

**Why this matters:**

Different traffic sources have different conversion rates:
- Email subscribers: 5-8% (high intent)
- Organic search: 2-4% (searching for solutions)
- Paid ads: 1-3% (depends on targeting)
- Social media: 0.5-2% (browsing, low intent)

**Action:** Identify your highest-converting traffic source and optimize for more of it.

**2. What devices do they use?**

Check GA4 → Tech → Overview → Device category

Typical split:
- Mobile: 60-70%
- Desktop: 25-35%
- Tablet: 5-10%

**Critical:** Check conversion rate by device.

**Red flag example:**
- Mobile: 70% of traffic, 1.2% conversion
- Desktop: 30% of traffic, 4.5% conversion

**This means your mobile experience is broken.** Prioritize [mobile optimization](/services/performance-optimization).

**3. What pages do they visit?**

Check GA4 → Engagement → Pages and screens

**Look for:**
- High traffic pages with high bounce rate (promising traffic, poor experience)
- Low traffic pages that convert well (promote these more)
- Checkout pages with high exit rate (friction points)

**4. How long do they stay?**

Check GA4 → Engagement → Average engagement time

**Benchmarks:**
- Homepage: 30-60 seconds
- Product page: 1-2 minutes
- Blog post: 2-4 minutes
- Checkout: 1-3 minutes

**Low engagement time = poor content or wrong audience.**

### Behavior Flow Analysis

**Map the customer journey:**

GA4 → Explore → Path exploration

**Typical journey:**
1. Homepage → Collection → Product → Cart → Checkout → Purchase

**What to look for:**

**Drop-off points:**
```
Homepage: 10,000 visitors
↓ (60% drop)
Collection: 4,000 visitors
↓ (50% drop)
Product: 2,000 visitors
↓ (70% drop)
Cart: 600 visitors
↓ (60% drop)
Checkout: 240 visitors
↓ (20% drop)
Purchase: 192 (1.92% overall conversion)
```

**Identify the biggest leak.**

In this example:
- Product → Cart has 70% drop (biggest issue)
- Collection → Product has 50% drop (second priority)

Focus optimization efforts on these steps first.

### Heatmap & Recording Analysis

**What to watch for:**

**1. Rage clicks** (clicking same element repeatedly)
- Button doesn't work
- Element looks clickable but isn't
- Slow loading response

**2. Dead clicks** (clicking non-interactive elements)
- Users expect something to happen
- Confusing UI

**3. Scroll depth**
- Most users don't scroll past 50% on product pages
- Important info is below the fold

**4. Mobile vs Desktop behavior differences**
- Mobile users struggle with small tap targets
- Desktop users interact with hover elements (mobile can't)

**5. Form abandonment patterns**
- Which field do users abandon at?
- Which field takes longest to complete?
- Do users skip back to earlier fields (confusion)?

**Real example:**

Watching session recordings, we noticed:
- 40% of users clicked the product image repeatedly
- They expected a zoom/gallery
- Our product images didn't zoom
- Added zoom functionality → 18% increase in add-to-cart rate

**Heatmaps and recordings reveal what data can't.**

## Step 3: Identify Conversion Funnel Leaks

**Time investment:** 2-3 hours
**Impact:** Pinpoints exact problems

Now drill down into specific pages and funnel steps.

![Conversion funnel optimization and leak identification](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

### Homepage Audit

**Critical questions:**

**1. Does it pass the 5-second test?**

Show homepage to 5-10 people for 5 seconds. Ask:
- What does this company sell?
- Who is it for?
- What's the main call-to-action?

**Pass:** 80%+ can answer correctly
**Fail:** Less than 60% can answer

**2. Is the value proposition clear?**

Checklist:
- [ ] Headline clearly states what you sell
- [ ] Subheadline explains who it's for or key benefit
- [ ] Primary CTA is visible without scrolling
- [ ] Social proof visible (customer count, reviews, logos)
- [ ] Trust signals present (shipping, returns, guarantees)

**3. Navigation analysis**

Check GA4 → Events → Click on [element]

**Questions:**
- What's the most clicked element?
- Do users find what they're looking for?
- Are there navigation dead-ends?

### Collection/Category Page Audit

**Critical elements:**

**1. Product grid**
- [ ] Products have clear images
- [ ] Prices are visible
- [ ] Reviews/ratings shown
- [ ] Quick add-to-cart available (if appropriate)
- [ ] Hover states provide more info

**2. Filtering & sorting**
- [ ] Filters are relevant to products
- [ ] Sort options make sense (price, popularity, newest)
- [ ] Filter selections are clear
- [ ] "Clear all" option available

**3. Mobile experience**
- [ ] Grid adapts (2 columns on mobile, 3-4 on desktop)
- [ ] Filters accessible (don't hide important filters)
- [ ] Images load quickly

**Red flags:**
- Collection page bounce rate >50%
- Average products viewed <3
- Filter usage <10%

### Product Page Audit

**This is where conversion happens.** Most important page to optimize.

![Product page optimization and ecommerce design](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1472851294608-062f824d29cc?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**Essential elements checklist:**

**Above the fold:**
- [ ] High-quality product images
- [ ] Product title clear and descriptive
- [ ] Price visible (including any discounts)
- [ ] Star rating + review count

**Below the fold:**
- [ ] Detailed product description
- [ ] Specifications/features
- [ ] Size guide (if apparel)
- [ ] Shipping information
- [ ] Return policy

**Analyze in GA4:**

Check: GA4 → Engagement → Pages → Filter for /products/

**Key metrics:**
- Add-to-cart rate (should be 8-15%)
- Bounce rate (should be <40%)
- Average time on page (should be 1-2+ minutes)

**Low add-to-cart rate causes:**
- Missing information (size, materials, dimensions)
- Poor images (can't see product clearly)
- No social proof (no reviews)
- Price concerns (no value justification)
- Lack of trust signals

### Cart Page Audit

**Critical checkpoint before checkout.**

**Must-haves:**
- [ ] Cart contents clearly displayed
- [ ] Easy to update quantities
- [ ] Easy to remove items
- [ ] Shipping costs shown or estimated
- [ ] Total cost calculated
- [ ] Trust signals (secure checkout badges)
- [ ] Progress indicator (step 1 of 3)
- [ ] Upsell/cross-sell (subtle, relevant)
- [ ] Exit-intent popup (if user tries to leave)

**Check cart abandonment rate:**

Formula: (Carts created - Checkouts initiated) / Carts created

**Benchmark:** 60-70% cart abandonment is normal
**Excellent:** <55% cart abandonment

**If >75% cart abandonment:**
- Unexpected shipping costs
- No guest checkout
- Complex cart interface
- Technical errors

### Checkout Audit

**The final hurdle.**

![Checkout process optimization and payment flow](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556742049-0cfed4f6a45d?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**Check checkout abandonment:**

GA4 → E-commerce purchases → Checkout funnel

**Typical drop-offs:**
- Shipping info: 20-30%
- Payment info: 15-25%
- Review order: 5-10%

**High abandonment causes:**
- Forced account creation
- Unexpected costs
- Complex forms
- No guest checkout
- Technical errors
- Slow loading

## Step 4: Review On-Page Elements

**Time investment:** 3-4 hours
**Impact:** Identifies specific fixes

Analyze individual page elements that affect conversion.

![On-page optimization and UX design elements](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581291518633-83b4ebd1d83e?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

### Visual Hierarchy Audit

**Scan each critical page and ask:**

**1. What draws attention first?**
Use heatmaps to verify where users look first.

**Should be:** Primary CTA, hero image, headline
**If not:** Visual hierarchy is broken

**2. Is the CTA obvious?**

CTA should be:
- High contrast color
- Largest button on page
- Positioned prominently
- Action-oriented text ("Add to Cart" not "Submit")

**3. Is information scannable?**

Users don't read. They scan.

Optimize for scanning:
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines)
- Bullet points for features
- Bold important words
- Plenty of whitespace
- Clear section headers

### Copy & Messaging Audit

**Headline test:**

For each major page:
- Does headline clearly state benefit?
- Is it customer-focused (not company-focused)?
- Does it address pain point or desire?

**Bad:** "About Our Company"
**Good:** "Premium Organic Coffee, Delivered Fresh"

**Bad:** "Welcome to FashionStore"
**Good:** "Sustainable Fashion That Fits Your Style"

**Product descriptions:**

Checklist:
- [ ] Benefits before features
- [ ] Addresses objections
- [ ] Tells a story (emotion)
- [ ] Scannable format
- [ ] Includes specifications (rational)
- [ ] Appropriate length (50-200 words typical)

### Trust Signal Audit

**Where trust signals should appear:**

**Homepage:**
- Customer count ("Join 50,000+ customers")
- Star rating
- Customer logos (if B2B)
- Press mentions ("Featured in...")

**Product page:**
- Reviews + ratings
- Number of reviews
- Customer photos
- Stock status (if low)
- Free shipping/returns
- Secure checkout badge

**Cart:**
- Security badges
- Money-back guarantee
- Customer support info

**Checkout:**
- SSL badge
- Payment security logos
- Order summary
- Return policy link

**Check your trust signals:**

- [ ] Specific numbers (not vague "thousands")
- [ ] Real testimonials (with names + photos)
- [ ] Recognizable logos (if you have them)
- [ ] Recent reviews (not 2019)
- [ ] Verified badges (not fake security icons)

### Mobile Experience Audit

**70% of ecommerce traffic is mobile.** Your mobile site must be optimized.

![Mobile shopping experience and responsive design](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512941937669-90a1b58e7e9c?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**Critical checks:**

**1. Page speed**

Test: Google PageSpeed Insights (free)

**Benchmarks:**
- Excellent: <2 seconds
- Good: 2-3 seconds
- Needs work: 3-4 seconds
- Poor: >4 seconds

**Common issues:**
- Unoptimized images (use WebP format)
- Too many scripts
- Render-blocking resources
- No caching

**2. Tap target sizes**

Minimum: 48px × 48px for buttons/links

Common mistakes:
- Tiny "X" on popups (impossible to tap)
- Small text links
- Crowded menu items

**3. Mobile navigation**

- [ ] Hamburger menu works smoothly
- [ ] Search easily accessible
- [ ] Cart icon always visible
- [ ] Back button works correctly
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling

**4. Forms on mobile**

- [ ] Large input fields
- [ ] Appropriate keyboard (email, phone, number)
- [ ] Minimal fields required
- [ ] Auto-advance to next field
- [ ] Error messages clear

**5. Mobile checkout**

- [ ] One-tap payment options (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
- [ ] Simplified forms
- [ ] Progress indicator
- [ ] No surprises (costs shown early)

### Site Speed Audit

**Every 1-second delay = 7% conversion drop.**

![Page speed testing and performance metrics](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551288049-bebda4e38f71?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**Tools:**
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- GTmetrix
- WebPageTest
- Shopify's Online Store Speed score

**What to measure:**

**Core Web Vitals:**
1. **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: <2.5s (how long for main content to load)
2. **FID (First Input Delay)**: <100ms (how long before site responds to interaction)
3. **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: <0.1 (page elements don't jump around)

**Common speed issues:**

1. **Images not optimized**
   - Solution: Convert to WebP, use lazy loading, compress

2. **Too many apps**
   - Solution: Remove unused apps, consolidate

3. **No caching**
   - Solution: Enable browser caching, use CDN

4. **Render-blocking scripts**
   - Solution: Defer non-critical JavaScript

5. **Large theme files**
   - Solution: Minify CSS/JS, remove unused code

## Step 5: Collect Qualitative Feedback

**Time investment:** 2-4 hours
**Impact:** Uncovers "why" behind the data

Numbers tell you **what** is happening. Feedback tells you **why**.

![User research and customer feedback collection](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542744173-8e7e53415bb0?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

### On-Site Surveys

**Tools:**
- Hotjar surveys
- Qualaroo
- Survicate

**What to ask:**

**Homepage survey:**
"What is your main reason for visiting today?"
- [ ] Browse products
- [ ] Looking for something specific
- [ ] Comparing prices
- [ ] Just discovered your site

**Exit-intent survey:**
"What stopped you from completing your purchase?"
- [ ] Shipping costs too high
- [ ] Not ready to buy
- [ ] Found a better price elsewhere
- [ ] Wanted more product information
- [ ] Payment security concerns

**Post-purchase survey:**
"How would you rate your shopping experience?"
- "What could we improve?"

### Customer Interviews

**Recruit 5-10 customers for 15-minute calls.**

**Questions to ask:**

1. "How did you first hear about us?"
2. "What problem were you trying to solve?"
3. "What almost stopped you from buying?"
4. "What information did you wish you had?"
5. "How was the checkout experience?"
6. "Would you recommend us? Why or why not?"

**Pay attention to:**
- Repeated concerns (3+ people mention same issue)
- Surprising insights (things you didn't expect)
- Language customers use (copy improvements)

### User Testing

**Recruit 5-10 target customers for usability testing.**

**Task:** "Find a [product type] and purchase it"

**Observe:**
- Where do they click first?
- Do they get confused anywhere?
- Do they find product information easily?
- Can they complete checkout without help?

**Tools:**
- UserTesting.com ($49 per test)
- UsabilityHub (free tier available)
- Maze (for prototypes)
- In-person testing (cheapest)

### Live Chat Analysis

**If you have live chat, analyze common questions:**

**Top 10 questions reveal missing information.**

**Example findings:**
- "Do you ship to Canada?" → Add shipping info to product pages
- "What's your return policy?" → Make return policy more visible
- "Is this true to size?" → Add size guide to product pages
- "When will this ship?" → Add estimated delivery dates

### Review Analysis

**Read your negative reviews (3-star and below).**

**Look for patterns:**

If 10+ reviews mention:
- "Shipping took forever" → Set better expectations
- "Not as described" → Improve product photos/descriptions
- "Doesn't fit" → Add size guide, customer photos
- "Customer service unresponsive" → Improve support

**Also read positive reviews:**
- What do customers love?
- What words do they use?
- Use this language in marketing

## Step 6: Prioritize & Create Action Plan

**Time investment:** 2-3 hours
**Impact:** Turns findings into results

You now have 20-50 issues identified. You can't fix everything at once.

**Prioritize strategically.**

![Prioritization framework and action planning](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517245386807-bb43f82c33c4?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

### The ICE Framework

Rate each issue on:

**Impact** (1-10): How much will this improve conversion?
**Confidence** (1-10): How sure are you it will work?
**Ease** (1-10): How easy is it to implement?

**ICE Score = (Impact + Confidence + Ease) / 3**

**Example:**

| Issue | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE Score | Priority |
|-------|--------|------------|------|-----------|----------|
| Add size guide to product pages | 8 | 9 | 8 | 8.3 | High |
| Reduce checkout form fields (8→3) | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9.0 | High |
| Improve mobile page speed | 8 | 8 | 4 | 6.7 | Medium |
| Redesign homepage | 7 | 6 | 3 | 5.3 | Low |
| Add live chat | 6 | 5 | 6 | 5.7 | Low |

**Prioritize by ICE score.**

### The Action Plan Template

**High Priority (ICE 8.0+) - Do First:**
1. _____________________________ (Expected impact: _____%)
2. _____________________________ (Expected impact: _____%)
3. _____________________________ (Expected impact: _____%)

**Medium Priority (ICE 6.0-7.9) - Do Next:**
1. _____________________________
2. _____________________________
3. _____________________________

**Low Priority (ICE <6.0) - Consider Later:**
1. _____________________________
2. _____________________________

### Implementation Roadmap

**Week 1-2: Quick Wins**
- Fix broken links
- Add missing trust badges
- Reduce form fields
- Add size guides

**Week 3-6: Medium Efforts**
- Improve product descriptions
- Optimize images for speed
- A/B test headlines
- Add customer reviews

**Week 7-12: Major Projects**
- Redesign checkout flow
- Implement exit-intent popups
- Build email flows

## Final Thoughts

A CRO audit is not a one-time fix.

It's the beginning of a continuous optimization process.

**The audit tells you WHAT to fix.**
**Testing tells you IF it works.**
**Iteration makes it better.**

**Expected timeline:**
- Audit: 1-2 weeks
- Implementation: 4-8 weeks
- Results: 2-4 weeks after changes

**Expected results:**
- 20-50% conversion improvement (6-12 months)
- 15-30% revenue increase
- 10-20% AOV increase

**Most important:** Don't try to fix everything at once.

Pick 3-5 high-impact changes. Implement. Test. Measure. Iterate.
