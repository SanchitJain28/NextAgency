faqs:
  - question: "What is the best Shopify page builder?"
    answer: "GemPages is the best overall Shopify page builder in 2025, offering 400+ templates, AI image-to-layout conversion, sales funnel builder, and advanced analytics. For maximum customization control, PageFly is the best choice with its pixel-perfect editor and built-in A/B testing."
  - question: "Are Shopify page builders worth it?"
    answer: "Yes, page builders are worth it for most stores. They provide design freedom without developers ($50-150/hour), enable quick design changes (hours vs weeks), include conversion optimization features, and cost $0-99/month. The average store sees 10-30% conversion improvement after implementing custom pages."
  - question: "Do page builders slow down Shopify stores?"
    answer: "Quality page builders add minimal load time (0.2-0.6 seconds). GemPages and PageFly add 0.3-0.5s, which is negligible. Poor builders or overdesigned pages can add 2-3+ seconds. Test page speed before/after with Google PageSpeed Insights. Look for builders with lazy loading and optimized code output."
  - question: "Can I use multiple page builders on one store?"
    answer: "Technically yes, but not recommended. Multiple builders create code conflicts, slow page speed, complicate management, and increase costs. Choose one builder and use it consistently. Exception: Tapita (blog-only) can complement a main page builder."
  - question: "What's the difference between GemPages and PageFly?"
    answer: "GemPages offers more templates (400 vs 120), AI features, sales funnels, and built-in conversion tools but works outside Shopify admin. PageFly offers more granular control, built-in A/B testing, SEO audits, custom code support, and works within Shopify admin. Both excellent - GemPages better for most users, PageFly better for power users."
  - question: "Do I need a page builder if I have a premium theme?"
    answer: "Yes, even premium themes ($200-300) have limited customization options. Page builders enable: unlimited layouts, campaign-specific pages, A/B testing, advanced customization without code, and unique designs. Premium themes provide foundation; page builders provide freedom."
  - question: "How long does it take to learn a page builder?"
    answer: "Basic pages: 1-2 hours with templates. Advanced customization: 5-10 hours. Full proficiency: 20-40 hours. EComposer is fastest to learn (30 minutes for basics). PageFly and Shogun have steeper learning curves but offer more power. Most builders include tutorials and support."
  - question: "Can page builders create mobile-responsive pages?"
    answer: "Yes, all quality page builders (GemPages, PageFly, Shogun) create automatically responsive pages that work on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Most allow device-specific editing to optimize each screen size separately. Always test pages on actual mobile devices before publishing."

Your Shopify theme looks... fine.

But it looks exactly like 10,000 other stores using the same theme.

And you can't customize it the way you want without hiring a developer.

**This is where page builders come in.**

A good page builder gives you design freedom without code, lets you create high-converting landing pages, and helps your store stand out.

We've tested 15+ Shopify page builders over the past year. Here are the 10 best, ranked by features, ease of use, performance, and value.

## What Is a Shopify Page Builder?

A Shopify page builder is an app that lets you create custom pages using a drag-and-drop editor—no coding required.

**What you can build:**

- Product landing pages
- Collection pages
- About/contact pages
- Blog pages (some builders)

**What makes them different from themes:**

**Shopify themes:**
- Pre-built layouts
- Limited customization
- One-time purchase ($0-300)
- Requires coding for advanced changes
- Same look as thousands of stores

**Page builders:**
- Unlimited custom layouts
- Drag-and-drop customization
- Monthly subscription ($0-99+)
- No coding needed
- Unique designs possible

**The key benefit:** Design freedom without developers.

## Why You Need a Page Builder

**1. Themes Are Limited**

Even premium Shopify themes ($200+) offer limited customization.

Want to move a section? Need code.
Want custom checkout flow? Need code.
Want unique product page layout? Need code.

Page builders remove these limitations.

Complete store redesign: $10,000-50,000

Developer timeline: 2-8 weeks
Page builder timeline: Hours to days

**4. A/B Testing**

Many page builders include built-in A/B testing.

Test different:
- Headlines
- CTA placements

- Layout structures

## GemPages vs PageFly: Which Is Better?

The two most popular builders compared directly:

**Choose GemPages if you want:**
- More templates (400 vs 120)
- Sales funnel builder
- AI image-to-layout
- Built-in conversion tools
- Don't mind working outside Shopify admin

**Choose PageFly if you want:**
- Maximum customization control
- Built-in A/B testing
- SEO audit tool
- Work within Shopify admin
- Custom code support

**Our take:**

Both are excellent. GemPages is better for most users (more templates, easier to use, conversion-focused). PageFly is better for power users who want granular control.

Can't decide? Both offer free plans—try both and see which feels better.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Choosing based on price alone**

Cheapest isn't always best value. A $15/month builder without A/B testing could cost you $1,000s in lost conversions.

**2. Not testing performance**

Some builders add significant load time. Test page speed before and after.

**3. Picking too complex for your needs**

Don't choose Shogun if you just need basic page customization. Simpler = faster results.

**4. Ignoring mobile**

70% of traffic is mobile. Test every page on mobile devices.

**5. Not using templates**

Starting from scratch wastes time. Use templates, then customize.

**6. Overdesigning**

More elements = slower pages + confused visitors. Keep it simple.

**7. Not tracking results**

Use analytics to see what pages convert best. Double down on winners.
