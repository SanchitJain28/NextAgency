faqs:
  - question: "What makes a good Shopify store name?"
    answer: "A good Shopify store name is memorable, easy to spell/pronounce, available as a .com domain, matches your brand personality, and doesn't limit future growth. Best names evoke emotion (Gymshark = strength, Allbirds = nature), work phonetically (ColourPop, Bombas), and sound like brands not descriptions ('Beardbrand' vs 'Beard Products Store'). Avoid generic descriptors, trendy slang that ages poorly, and hard-to-spell names."
  - question: "Should I use my own name for my Shopify store?"
    answer: "Use your own name only if you have an existing following (like Kylie Cosmetics). Personal brand names work for celebrities, influencers, or industry experts with recognition. For everyone else, choose a brand name that describes the product or evokes desired emotions. Exception: If you're selling handmade/artisan goods and 'made by [your name]' is the selling point, personal names can work."
  - question: "How important is getting the .com domain?"
    answer: "Very important. The .com domain is still the most trusted and memorable extension. If unavailable, options include: adding modifiers (ShopYourName.com), using .co or .shop extensions (increasingly accepted), or slightly modifying the name. Budget $20-500 for good domains. Expensive domains ($1,000+) are worth it only if the name is perfect and central to your brand strategy."
  - question: "Can I rebrand my Shopify store later?"
    answer: "Yes, but it's costly and disruptive. Rebrand if your current name limits growth, causes confusion with another brand, has a problematic domain, or you consistently cringe saying it. Don't rebrand just because you're bored or saw a cooler name. Costs include new domain, updated marketing materials, confused customers, and lost SEO value. Only rebrand when benefits clearly outweigh these costs."
  - question: "What are common Shopify store naming mistakes?"
    answer: "Common mistakes: Generic descriptors ('The Clothing Store'), trendy slang that ages poorly ('Lit Gadgets', 'Fleek Fashion'), hard-to-spell names (Xtreme Apparyl), location-locking unnecessarily (NYC Fashion when shipping nationwide), being too clever ('ShopEase' - unclear meaning), and choosing names similar to major brands. Also avoid names that limit expansion (SockLab can't easily sell shirts) and those without available domains or social handles."
  - question: "How long should a Shopify store name be?"
    answer: "Shorter is generally better. Ideal length: 1-2 words (Gymshark, Allbirds, Bombas). Maximum: 3 words (Death Wish Coffee, Naked & Famous Denim). Longer names are harder to remember, type, and fit on marketing materials. If your concept needs explanation, use a tagline instead of cramming it all in the name. Test: Can someone hear your name once and spell it correctly?"
  - question: "Should I include keywords in my store name for SEO?"
    answer: "Keyword-focused names ('Best Running Shoes Store') help SEO but sacrifice brand memorability. Better approach: Choose a brandable name (Allbirds) and use keywords in taglines, product pages, and content. Successful stores rank for keywords through content, not store names. Exception: If selling highly specific products to a niche market, descriptive names can work (PopSockets clearly describes the product)."
  - question: "What if my perfect store name is already taken?"
    answer: "If your perfect name's domain is taken: Check if it's for sale (many inactive domains are), consider slight variations (add 'shop', 'get', or 'the'), use alternative extensions (.co, .shop), or develop a secondary name you like equally. If a social handle is taken by an inactive account, message offering $50-200 to buy it. Don't compromise on a confusing name just for perfect handles—brand consistency matters more than perfection."

Most Shopify store name guides give you the same generic advice:

"Make it memorable!"
"Keep it short!"
"Include keywords!"

Cool. Super helpful. 🙄

Here's what they don't tell you: store names like "Urban Clothing Co" or "Modern Style Shop" sound fine but they're forgettable. Nobody's talking about them. Nobody remembers them the next day.

![Business branding and naming strategy](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553877522-43269d4ea984?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

Meanwhile, names like **Gymshark** and **Death Wish Coffee**? Those stick.

I've analyzed hundreds of successful Shopify stores. The ones that blow up all have one thing in common: their name does something more than just describe what they sell.

Let me show you 10 stores that nailed their names—and break down exactly why they work.

## 1. Gymshark - The $1.4 Billion Name

**What they sell:** Gym apparel, athletic wear
**Revenue:** $1.4 billion valuation in 10 years
**Why the name works:**

Gymshark is perfect because it's aggressive without being obnoxious.

![Gym workout equipment and fitness motivation](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1534438327276-14e5300c3a48?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

"Gym" tells you exactly what category they're in. No confusion.

"Shark" implies predatory dominance, strength, relentless pursuit. It's the mentality every person in the gym wants—especially the target demographic (young guys trying to get jacked).

**The psychology:**
Combining a neutral word (gym) with a power animal (shark) creates instant brand personality. You're not just buying workout clothes. You're buying the shark mentality.

**What makes it memorable:**
It's visceral. When you hear "Gymshark," you picture something fierce and athletic. That mental image sticks way better than "Athletic Apparel Co."

**Would it work for other niches?**
This formula (neutral word + power word) works across categories:
- TechTiger (electronics)
- BeautyWolf (cosmetics)
- HomeHawk ([furniture](/blog/how-to-build-furniture-shopify-store-complete-guide))

But only if the power word aligns with your brand vibe. Don't force it.

**The lesson:** Combine a category descriptor with a word that embodies the feeling you want customers to have.

## 2. Allbirds - The Eco-Friendly Genius

**What they sell:** Sustainable sneakers, wool shoes
**Revenue:** $300M+ annually, went public in 2021
**Why the name works:**

"Allbirds" is brilliant for a sustainability-focused brand.

![Natural environment with birds and nature](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1444464666168-49d633b86797?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

It implies:
- Natural (birds = nature)
- Freedom and lightness (birds fly)
- Universal appeal ("all" birds, not just some)
- Inclusivity (shoes for everyone)

**The psychology:**
Environmental brands need names that feel organic without being preachy. "Allbirds" accomplishes this. It's playful, not serious. Natural, not corporate.

Compare to "EcoStep" or "GreenWalk"—both sound like they're trying too hard.

**What makes it memorable:**
It's unexpected. Birds have nothing to do with shoes. That disconnect makes you think about it, which improves recall.

**The lesson:** For sustainability/natural products, choose names that evoke nature without being literal. Metaphors > descriptions.

---

## 3. Death Wish Coffee - The Bold Play

**What they sell:** High-caffeine coffee
**Revenue:** Multi-million dollar brand, appeared on Shark Tank
**Why the name works:**

This name is audacious as hell. And it works because coffee culture embraces extreme language.

![Strong dark coffee brewing process](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1447933601403-0c6688de566e?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

Coffee drinkers say things like "I need coffee or I'll die" or "don't talk to me before my coffee." Death Wish leans into that.

**The psychology:**
The name filters out non-customers. If you want mild, pleasant coffee, you're not buying something called "Death Wish." But if you want the strongest coffee on the market, this name signals exactly that.

**What makes it memorable:**
It's provocative. You remember it because it's borderline offensive. Most brands play it safe. This one doesn't.

**Would it work for other niches?**
Bold, edgy names work for products where intensity is a selling point:
- Fitness (already done with Gymshark)
- Energy drinks
- Hot sauce
- Gaming accessories

But not for... baby products. Or insurance. Context matters.

**The lesson:** If your product's main benefit is extreme or intense, embrace a bold name. It pre-qualifies your customer.

---

## 4. Bombas - The Subtle Sophistication

**What they sell:** Socks, underwear, comfort apparel
**Revenue:** $200M+ annually
**Why the name works:**

"Bombas" is Latin for "bumblebees."

![Bees working together in nature](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558642452-9d2a7deb7f62?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

Why bees? Because bees live in a hive and work as a community—which aligns with Bombas' mission of donating one item for every item purchased.

Most customers don't know the Latin origin. They just know it sounds friendly, approachable, and slightly quirky.

**The psychology:**
The name doesn't scream "SOCKS!" and that's smart. It leaves room for expansion (they now sell underwear and t-shirts). If they'd called it "SockLab" or "ComfySocks," that expansion would feel weird.

**What makes it memorable:**
It's unique in the space. There's no other sock brand called Bombas. That distinctiveness = easier word-of-mouth.

"Where'd you get those socks?"
"Bombas"
"What?"
"B-O-M-B-A-S"

That confusion actually helps—now they're Googling it.

**The lesson:** Unique > obvious. If your name makes people ask "what does that mean?", you've created an opportunity to tell your brand story.

---

## 5. Naked & Famous Denim - The Edgy Risk

**What they sell:** Premium denim jeans
**Revenue:** Multi-million dollar brand (private)
**Why the name works:**

This name is a power move. It's provocative enough to get attention but sophisticated enough for a premium product.

![Premium denim jeans close-up detail](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542272604-787c3835535d?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

"Naked" suggests raw, unfiltered, authentic.
"Famous" suggests quality, status, aspiration.

Together? It's a jab at celebrity fashion brands that prioritize name over craftsmanship. Naked & Famous is saying: "Our denim is famous for being good, not for who's wearing it."

**The psychology:**
The name appeals to people who want quality without the hype. It's anti-establishment while still being premium.

**What makes it memorable:**
It's edgy without being crass. The kind of name you'd tell a friend about.

**The lesson:** If you're in a saturated market (like denim), a provocative name helps you punch above your weight.

---

## 6. ColourPop - The Instant Vibe

**What they sell:** Affordable cosmetics
**Revenue:** $100M+ annually
**Why the name works:**

"ColourPop" perfectly captures the brand experience: fun, vibrant, accessible makeup.

![Colorful cosmetics and makeup products](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596462502278-27bfdc403348?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

"Colour" = makeup, obviously
"Pop" = burst of energy, excitement, something unexpected

The British spelling ("Colour" vs "Color") adds a touch of sophistication without feeling pretentious.

**The psychology:**
This name targets Gen Z and Millennials who want makeup that's playful, not serious. It signals "this is fun" before you even see the products.

Compare to "Luxury Cosmetics" or "Beauty Essentials"—both sound corporate and boring.

**What makes it memorable:**
The double "pop" sound (ColourPOP) is phonetically satisfying. It's fun to say out loud.

**The lesson:** Use sound. Names that have rhythm or alliteration (ColourPop, Coca-Cola, PayPal) are easier to remember.

---

## 7. Beardbrand - The Community Builder

**What they sell:** Beard grooming products
**Revenue:** $10M+ annually
**Why the name works:**

"Beardbrand" does two things:
1. Tells you what they sell (beard products)
2. Positions it as a lifestyle brand (not just products, a whole brand)

![Bearded man grooming and styling](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1521119989659-a83eee488004?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

Founder Eric Bandholz started it to build a community of "urban beardsmen"—guys who have beards but aren't lumberjacks. The name reinforces that it's bigger than just beard oil.

**The psychology:**
By calling it a "brand" (Beardbrand), they're inviting customers to join something. It's identity-based marketing.

**What makes it memorable:**
It's descriptive without being generic. "BeardProducts.com" tells you what they sell but feels corporate. "Beardbrand" feels like a movement.

**The lesson:** Adding "brand" or "co" to a niche word makes it feel like a lifestyle, not just a product.

---

## 8. PopSockets - The Function Name

**What they sell:** Phone grips and accessories
**Revenue:** $200M+ annually
**Why the name works:**

PopSockets is purely functional—and that's perfect for this product.

![Phone with grip accessory on desk](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512941937669-90a1b58e7e9c?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

"Pop" = the action (it pops out from your phone)
"Sockets" = the attachment point

The name literally describes what the product does. No metaphor needed.

**The psychology:**
For products people don't know exist, descriptive names help. If they'd called it "PhoneGrip" or something generic, it works. But "PopSockets" has the benefit of being slightly fun while still being clear.

**What makes it memorable:**
It's onomatopoeia. When you say "PopSockets," you can hear the action. That sensory connection aids memory.

**The lesson:** For innovative products, descriptive names reduce confusion. Add a fun sound and you've got a winner.

---

## 9. Kylie Cosmetics - The Personal Brand Play

**What they sell:** Cosmetics, lip kits
**Revenue:** $200M+ annually (peaked higher)
**Why the name works:**

This one's different because it leverages Kylie Jenner's existing fame.

![Luxury cosmetics and beauty products](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522335789203-aabd1fc54bc9?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

For most people, using your first name is risky. But if you have a recognizable personal brand (celebrity, influencer, industry expert), it works.

"Kylie" = her personal brand, 300M+ followers
"Cosmetics" = what she sells

Simple, clear, instant recognition.

**The psychology:**
People buy from people they feel connected to. By putting her name on it, every purchase feels personal.

**What makes it memorable:**
If you know Kylie, you'll remember Kylie Cosmetics. If you don't... the name won't mean much to you.

**The lesson:** Personal brand names only work if you already have a following. For everyone else, skip this approach.

---

## 10. Pipcorn - The Playful Twist

**What they sell:** Mini heirloom popcorn
**Revenue:** Multi-million (appeared on Shark Tank)
**Why the name works:**

"Pipcorn" is a playful take on "popcorn" that highlights the product's key differentiator: the kernels are tiny.

![Popcorn kernels and snack food](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1578849278619-e73505e9610f?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

"Pip" = small seed or kernel
"Corn" = obvious

It's clever without being confusing.

**The psychology:**
The name makes you smile. That positive association transfers to the product. You're not just buying popcorn—you're buying something cute and different.

**What makes it memorable:**
It's a familiar word with a twist. Your brain recognizes "popcorn" but does a double-take on "Pipcorn." That cognitive disruption aids recall.

**The lesson:** Take a common word and twist it slightly. It signals "we're different" without requiring explanation.

## What These Names Have in Common

Looking at these 10 stores, patterns emerge:

![Brand strategy and naming patterns](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552664730-d307ca884978?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**1. They evoke emotion**
Gymshark = aggressive strength
Allbirds = natural freedom
Death Wish = intense energy

**2. They're easy to say and spell**
All 10 names are phonetically simple. You won't misspell "Bombas" after hearing it once.

**3. They work as domains**
Gymshark.com, Allbirds.com, DeathWishCoffee.com—all clean, no hyphens or numbers.

**4. They scale beyond one product**
Bombas started with socks, now sells underwear and t-shirts.
Beardbrand started with beard oil, now has full grooming line.
Good names don't trap you.

**5. They sound like brands, not descriptions**
"Gymshark" sounds like a brand.
"Athletic Apparel Store" sounds like... a store.

## What Makes a Bad Shopify Store Name

Let me show you what doesn't work:

![Examples of poor branding choices](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517048676732-d65bc937f952?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**Generic descriptors:**
- The Clothing Store
- Best Fashion Shop
- Quality Products Co.

These tell you nothing. They're forgettable. And they're impossible to rank for (everyone uses these terms).

**Too clever by half:**
- ShopEase (what does this mean?)
- BuyNow Boutique (sounds spammy)
- ClickCart (sounds like software, not a store)

**Trendy slang that ages poorly:**
- Lit Gadgets (already feels dated)
- Fleek Fashion (cringe in 2026)
- Dope Threads (trying too hard)

**Hard to spell or pronounce:**
- Xtreme Apparyl
- Phashion Phorward
- Shoppe Stylé

If people can't spell it, they can't find it. If they can't pronounce it, they won't recommend it.

**Location-locked when you don't need to be:**
- Chicago Clothing Co (what if you ship nationwide?)
- NYC Fashion Finds (limiting for no reason)

Unless your business model requires local customers, don't box yourself in.

## How to Actually Choose Your Store Name

Okay, enough examples. How do you create a name for your store?

![Creative brainstorming and strategy session](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1531403009284-440f080d1e12?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**Step 1: Define your brand personality**

Are you:
- Bold and aggressive? (Gymshark, Death Wish)
- Playful and fun? (ColourPop, Pipcorn)
- Natural and sustainable? (Allbirds)
- Sophisticated and premium? (Naked & Famous)

Your name should match this vibe.

**Step 2: List relevant words**

Brainstorm 20-30 words related to:
- Your product
- Your target customer
- Your brand values
- Emotions you want to evoke

Don't filter yet. Just list.

**Step 3: Combine and experiment**

Try combining words:
- Category word + power word (Gymshark)
- Descriptive + action (PopSockets)
- Metaphor + category (Allbirds)
- Twist on common word (Pipcorn)

**Step 4: Test the name**

Say it out loud. Does it sound good?

Text it to someone. Can they spell it back correctly?

Google it. Is the .com available? Is it already a brand?

Check social media. Can you get @yourname on Instagram/TikTok?

**Step 5: Live with it for a week**

Don't rush. A week from now, does the name still feel right? Or does it already feel stale?

If you're sick of it after a week, it's not the one.

## The Domain Dilemma

You've got the perfect name. But the .com is taken or costs $10,000.

![Domain registration and web hosting](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484807352052-23338990c6c6?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**Options:**

**1. Add a modifier**
- ShopGymshark.com
- GetAllbirds.com
- Try[YourName].com

Not ideal, but workable if the name is strong enough.

**2. Use alternative extensions**
- .co (getting more accepted)
- .shop (Shopify-friendly)
- .store (obvious for ecommerce)

**3. Slightly modify the name**
- Gymshark → GymSharkFit
- Allbirds → AllbirdsShop

Only do this if it doesn't dilute the brand.

**4. Buy the expensive domain**

If the name is *perfect* and the domain is "only" $5K-10K, it might be worth it. You'll spend more than that on ads in your first year.

**What I'd do:**
If the .com is available and under $20, buy it immediately.

If it's $50-500, still buy it if the name is great.

If it's $1,000+, consider alternatives unless you're certain this is *the* name.

## The Social Media Handle Problem

You've got the domain. But @yourname on Instagram is taken by someone with 47 followers who posted once in 2019.

![Social media marketing and branding](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1611162617474-5b21e879e113?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**Options:**

**1. Add "shop" or "official"**
- @ShopGymshark
- @OfficialBombas

**2. Add "the"**
- @TheAllbirds
- @TheDeathWishCoffee

**3. Use underscores**
- @Gym_Shark
- @Colour_Pop

(Less ideal, but sometimes necessary)

**4. Ask nicely or make an offer**

DM the account holder. Offer $50-200 for the handle. Many inactive accounts will sell.

**What matters most:**
Consistency. If your store is Gymshark.com, your Instagram should be as close to @Gymshark as possible.

## When to Rebrand

You've launched as "Urban Style Co" and it's... fine. But not exciting. Should you rebrand?

![Business rebranding and strategy planning](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556761175-4b46a572b786?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**Rebrand if:**
- Your current name limits growth (too niche or location-specific)
- You consistently get confused with another brand
- You cringe when saying your name
- Your domain is a mess (.net with hyphens)

**Don't rebrand if:**
- You're just bored of it (wait it out)
- You saw a cooler name (grass-is-greener syndrome)
- Sales are slow (your name isn't the problem)

**The cost of rebranding:**
- New domain ($20-$10,000)
- New social handles
- Updated all marketing materials
- Confused existing customers
- Lost [SEO](/blog/shopify-seo-guide-how-to-rank-google) value on old domain

Only rebrand if the benefits clearly outweigh these costs.

## Real Talk: Your Name Isn't Everything

Here's the truth nobody wants to hear: your store name matters, but it's not make-or-break.

![Business success and growth metrics](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1460925895917-afdab827c52f?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

"Gymshark" is a great name. But the brand succeeded because:
- They made quality products
- They nailed their target market
- They used influencer marketing brilliantly
- The founder was relentless

A mediocre name with great marketing beats a great name with mediocre marketing.

**So yes, spend time on your name. But don't spend 6 months agonizing over it.**

Pick something good, not perfect. Then focus on actually building the business.

## Quick Decision Framework

Still stuck? Use this:

![Decision making process and checklist](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1484480974693-6ca0a78fb36b?w=1200&h=600&fit=crop)

**If your name:**
- ✅ Is easy to spell and pronounce
- ✅ .com domain is available for under $500
- ✅ Matches your brand personality
- ✅ Doesn't limit future growth
- ✅ Isn't already a huge brand
- ✅ Sounds good when you say it out loud

**Then it's probably fine. Launch with it.**

Stop second-guessing. Build the store.
