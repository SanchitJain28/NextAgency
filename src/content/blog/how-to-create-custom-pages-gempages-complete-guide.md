Each optimized for specific conversion goals."
  - question: "Is GemPages better than Shopify themes?"
    answer: "GemPages offers more flexibility than Shopify themes: unlimited custom layouts vs pre-built designs, drag-and-drop customization vs code requirements, campaign-specific pages vs one design, built-in analytics and A/B testing vs limited insights. Themes cost $0-300 one-time; GemPages costs $29-199/month but provides ongoing design freedom. Best for stores wanting unique designs and regular optimization."
  - question: "How long does it take to create a page in GemPages?"
    answer: "Time varies by complexity: Simple landing page (1-2 hours), Homepage (2-4 hours), Custom product page (3-5 hours), Complex funnel (1-2 days). Using templates cuts time 50-70%. First page takes longer (learning curve); subsequent pages take half the time. AI image-to-layout feature can convert designs in 2 minutes, then requires 1-2 hours customization."
  - question: "Does GemPages slow down my Shopify store?"
    answer: "Quality GemPages implementations add minimal load time (0.3-0.5 seconds). Optimize by: compressing images, enabling lazy loading, removing unused elements, minimizing custom code, testing with Google PageSpeed Insights. Target: <3 seconds mobile load time. Poorly optimized pages (large images, heavy animations) can add 2-3+ seconds. Always test performance before publishing."
  - question: "Can I use GemPages with my existing theme?"
    answer: "Yes, GemPages works with all Shopify themes. It replaces individual page editors while keeping your theme's header, footer, and navigation. You can: use GemPages for specific pages (landing pages, homepage), keep theme for others (blog, policies), mix approaches as needed. No theme changes required. GemPages pages inherit theme's global styles but can be fully customized."
  - question: "How much does GemPages cost?"
    answer: "GemPages pricing: Free plan (1 page, full features, test before buying), $29/month (unlimited pages, remove branding, email support), $59/month (advanced features, priority support, sales funnels), $199/month (agency features, white label, team collaboration). Annual billing saves 20%. All plans include 400+ templates, mobile optimization, and analytics. 14-day money-back guarantee."
  - question: "What's the difference between GemPages and PageFly?"
    answer: "GemPages: 400+ templates, AI image-to-layout, sales funnel builder, built-in analytics, works outside Shopify admin, $29-199/month. PageFly: 120+ templates, built-in A/B testing, SEO audits, works in Shopify admin, more granular control, $24-99/month. Both excellent - GemPages better for templates/funnels, PageFly better for maximum control/testing. Try both free plans to compare."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

![Common web design mistakes](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519389950473-47ba0277781c?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop)

**Mistake #1: Not Optimizing for Mobile**

70% of traffic is mobile, but many builders only design for desktop.

**Fix:**
- Design mobile-first
- Test every page on actual devices
- Simplify for smaller screens
- Ensure touch targets are 48px+

**Mistake #2: Too Many Elements**

More elements = slower page + confused visitors.

**Fix:**
- Every element should serve a purpose
- Remove anything that doesn't drive conversion
- Test page speed after adding elements
- Aim for <3 second load time

**Mistake #3: Ignoring Page Speed**

Beautiful page that takes 6 seconds to load loses 50% of visitors.

**Fix:**
- Compress all images
- Enable lazy loading
- Minimize custom code
- Remove unused apps/scripts
- Test with Google PageSpeed Insights

**Mistake #4: Unclear CTAs**

Multiple competing buttons confuse visitors.

**Fix:**
- One primary CTA per section
- High contrast buttons
- Action-oriented text
- Obvious what happens when clicked

**Mistake #5: No Testing**

Launching without testing leads to broken experiences.

**Fix:**
- Preview on all devices
- Test all links and forms
- Check speed
- Get feedback before publishing
- Monitor analytics after launch

**Mistake #6: Copying Templates Exactly**

Templates are starting points, not final products.

**Fix:**
- Customize colors to match brand
- Replace images with your products
- Rewrite copy for your audience
- Add your unique elements
- Match your brand voice

**Mistake #7: Forgetting SEO**

Beautiful page that no one finds is useless.

**Fix:**
- Configure page title and meta description
- Use header tags properly (H1, H2, H3)
- Add alt text to images
- Create descriptive URLs
- Internal linking to other pages

- Remove friction (one-click CTAs)
- Create urgency (countdowns, scarcity)
- Build trust (reviews, guarantees)
- Guide discovery (clear navigation)
- Optimize continuously (test and iterate)

**Start with one page.** Make it convert. Then build more.
