faqs:
  - question: "When should I start preparing my Shopify store for the holidays?"
    answer: "Start holiday preparation in August-September, not November. Timeline: August-September (plan bundles, order inventory, design landing pages), October (launch early bird campaigns, publish gift guides, test systems), November (execute BFCM, daily emails, inventory management), December (shipping deadlines, gift cards, express shipping), January (post-holiday sales, returns, retention). 21% of shoppers start browsing in September, so early preparation captures maximum revenue. Stores starting in November miss 30-40% of potential holiday sales."
  - question: "What types of gift bundles sell best during holidays?"
    answer: "Best-performing bundles: \"For [Person]\" bundles (Him/Her/Kids/Parents convert 20-30% higher than individual products), \"Complete the Look\" sets (outfit bundles for fashion), \"Bestseller Bundles\" (top 3-4 products together), \"Try Everything\" samplers (beauty/food brands), and \"Build Your Own\" custom bundles. Price bundles 10-20% below individual item total. Use Shopify Bundles app (free) or Bold Bundles ($20-80/mo). Present with styled photos showing bundle together, gift-ready packaging, and clear savings messaging."
  - question: "How should I structure holiday promo codes for maximum sales?"
    answer: "Strategic promo code framework: October early bird codes (EARLYBIRD20, VIP25 for email subscribers), November BFCM codes (BFCM30 for 30% off, FLASH40 for 6-hour urgency), December gift codes (GIFTGIVER20, FREESHIP, WRAPPING for added value), January clearance codes (THANKYOU30, CLEARANCE50). Use minimum thresholds to increase AOV (HOLIDAY20 for orders $125+). Don't publicize all codes—reserve some for email subscribers, cart abandoners, and VIPs. Stack bundles with promo codes for powerful offers."
  - question: "What payment options should I add for holiday shopping?"
    answer: "Essential payment flexibility: Enable Shop Pay Installments (built into Shopify, free), Afterpay (4 payments, popular with Gen Z/Millennials), Klarna (4 payments or monthly financing), and Affirm (for purchases $500+). Buy Now Pay Later drove $18.2 billion in holiday sales last year. Stores adding BNPL see 20-30% AOV increase and 10-15% conversion rate boost. Display prominently on product pages (\"Or 4 payments of $25\"), mention in emails, and highlight on bundles. It's free for merchants and dramatically reduces purchase friction."
  - question: "How do I create holiday gift guides that actually drive sales?"
    answer: "Effective gift guide types: \"Gifts Under $X\" (budget-focused), \"Gifts For [Person]\" (removes decision paralysis), \"Best [Category] Gifts 2025\" (SEO gold), and personality-based guides (Coffee Addicts, Fitness Fanatics). Build as dedicated landing pages (GemPages/PageFly), blog posts (SEO-optimized), or collection pages. Use lifestyle images showing products in use, clear pricing, specific gift messaging (\"Perfect for coffee lovers\"), and easy add-to-cart. Promote via email segments, Pinterest (huge gift discovery), Instagram Stories, and targeted ads. 91% of adults celebrate winter holidays—gift guides simplify their shopping."
  - question: "What shipping strategy works best for holiday sales?"
    answer: "Holiday shipping essentials: Calculate and display deadlines everywhere (Standard: order by Dec 18, 2-Day: Dec 22, Overnight: Dec 23), offer multiple speeds (Standard free over $X, Express, Overnight), set free shipping threshold 20% above AOV to increase cart values, show progress bars (\"Add $12 for free shipping\"), communicate early and often (homepage banner, product pages, cart, checkout, emails). For last-minute shoppers: promote digital gift cards after shipping deadlines pass. International shipping: add extra buffers, state customs delays possible, recommend early December orders."
  - question: "How do I optimize my Shopify store design for holidays?"
    answer: "Holiday design optimization: Update homepage hero with festive banner and holiday messaging, add \"Holiday Gifts\" to navigation menu with quick links, display countdown timers (\"X days until Christmas\"), feature gift bundles prominently, add gift wrapping and message options at checkout, show shipping deadlines everywhere, update product pages with \"Perfect gift for...\" messaging, use subtle festive elements (gold accents, winter blues—not tacky red/green overload). CRITICAL: Test mobile experience (70% of traffic)—fast loading, readable text, tappable buttons, smooth checkout. Use apps: Snowfall Effect, Promo Bar, Holiday Theme Editor."
  - question: "What post-holiday strategies retain seasonal customers?"
    answer: "Post-holiday retention tactics: Send thank-you emails within 24 hours requesting reviews (incentivize with 10% off), extend return window through January 31 (builds trust), run post-holiday clearance sale (December 26-January), offer loyalty program invites (convert one-time buyers: \"Join VIP for 15% off next order\"), send re-engagement campaigns in February-March (\"We miss you—20% off\"), handle returns gracefully (easy process, fast refunds, offer store credit first). Holiday buyers are valuable—20-30% can become repeat customers with proper nurturing. Don't abandon them January 1st."

# How to Get Your Shopify Store Ready for the Holidays (Before It's Too Late)

Last year's Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend: $11.5 billion in sales on Shopify alone.

24% increase from the previous year.

And most of that went to stores that prepared months in advance.

The stores that waited until November to "get ready"? They scrambled, missed opportunities, and watched competitors clean up.

Here's the truth: the holiday season isn't won in December. It's won in September and October when you're building gift bundles, setting up promo strategies, and optimizing your store for peak traffic.

I've helped dozens of Shopify stores prepare for holidays. The ones that follow this playbook? They do 40-60% of their annual revenue in Q4.

Here's exactly how to get your store ready.

![Holiday shopping preparation for ecommerce](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1513885535751-8b9238bd345a?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

## The Holiday Shopping Timeline (Start Earlier Than You Think)

Most store owners think holiday prep starts in November.

Wrong.

**Here's when shoppers actually start:**

- **September:** 21% of shoppers start browsing and planning
- **October:** Early bird deals, gift guide research
- **November:** Black Friday/Cyber Monday (peak buying)
- **December:** Last-minute shoppers, gift cards, express shipping

**Your prep timeline:**

**August-September: Foundation**
- Audit inventory
- Plan bundles and gift sets
- Design holiday landing pages
- Set up promo code strategy
- Update store theme with festive elements

**October: Launch**
- Launch early bird deals
- Publish gift guides
- Start email campaigns
- Test checkout flow
- Finalize shipping strategies

**November: Execute**
- Black Friday/Cyber Monday campaigns
- Daily email sequences
- Retargeting ads
- Live chat support ready
- Inventory management

**December: Close Strong**
- Last-minute gift messaging
- Gift card promotions
- Express shipping options
- Post-holiday sales planning

**January: Retain**
- Thank you emails
- Loyalty program invites
- Post-holiday sales
- Analyze what worked

If you're reading this and it's already November, don't panic. You can still execute parts of this. But next year? Start in August.

## Strategy #1: Create Irresistible Gift Bundles & Holiday Hampers

Gift bundles are the secret weapon of holiday sales.

**Why they work:**

1. **Higher AOV** - Bundle of 3 items at $75 vs single item at $30
2. **Simplify decisions** - "Perfect gift for Mom" beats "Figure it out yourself"
3. **Move inventory** - Bundle slow-moving items with bestsellers
4. **Stand out** - Everyone sells products. Not everyone sells curated gift experiences.

**Types of bundles to create:**

### 1. The "For [Person]" Bundle

Instead of making customers build their own gift, do it for them.

Examples:
- "For Him: The Complete Grooming Set" (beard oil + trimmer + balm)
- "For Her: Self-Care Essentials" (candle + bath bombs + face mask)
- "For Fitness Lovers" (resistance bands + water bottle + towel)
- "For the Home Chef" (spice set + apron + cookbook)

**How to price:**
- Calculate total individual price
- Offer 10-20% discount on bundle
- Example: Items total $85 individually → Bundle price $70 (saves $15)

![Gift bundle product packaging](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1549465220-1a8b9238cd48?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

### 2. The "Complete the Look" Bundle

Perfect for fashion/apparel stores.

Example:
- "Winter Ready" (coat + scarf + gloves + beanie)
- "Date Night Outfit" (dress + shoes + clutch + jewelry)
- "Work From Home Comfort" (hoodie + joggers + slippers)

### 3. The "Bestseller Bundle"

Take your 3-4 top products and bundle them.

Example:
- "Customer Favorites Set - Our 3 Most-Loved Products"
- Social proof built-in (these are bestsellers for a reason)

### 4. The "Try Everything" Sample Bundle

Great for beauty, food, or beverage brands.

Example:
- "Coffee Lover's Sampler" (5 different coffee blends, 4oz each)
- "Skincare Discovery Set" (cleanser + toner + moisturizer in travel sizes)

### 5. The "Build Your Own" Bundle

Let customers choose 3, 4, or 5 items and get a discount.

Example:
- "Pick Any 3 for $99" (normally $40 each)
- Creates customization + discount motivation

![Holiday gift set arrangement](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607344645866-009c7b3a1b57?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

**How to create bundles in Shopify:**

**Option 1: Shopify Bundles App (Free)**
- Install from Shopify App Store
- Create fixed bundles (you choose the products)
- Auto-syncs inventory
- Simple, clean, works out of box

**Option 2: Advanced Bundle Apps**
- Bold Bundles ($20-80/mo) - more customization
- Bundle Builder by Shophooks ($10-30/mo)
- Bundler ($7-20/mo)
- Better for complex bundles, volume discounts, tiered pricing

**Bundle presentation tips:**

**Product images:**
- Don't just show individual items
- Create a styled photo of the bundle together
- Show it wrapped or in a gift box
- Add "Everything included:" list with checkmarks

**Naming:**
- Be specific and gift-oriented
- ❌ "Bundle #1"
- ✓ "The Cozy Night In Bundle - Perfect for Her"

**Descriptions:**
- Lead with who it's for
- List what's included (with individual prices)
- Show the savings
- Add gift messaging

Example:
"Treat Mom to a spa day at home. This curated set includes our bestselling lavender candle ($28), organic bath salts ($22), and silk sleep mask ($18). Normally $68 - now just $55. Arrives in a beautiful gift-ready box."

**Scarcity & urgency:**
- "Limited Holiday Edition - Only 100 Sets Available"
- "Order by Dec 20 for Christmas Delivery"
- "48 sets sold in last 24 hours"

## Strategy #2: Strategic Promo Code System

Random discounts don't work. Strategic ones do.

**The holiday promo code framework:**

### Early Bird Codes (October)

**Goal:** Capture early planners, reward loyal customers

**Examples:**
- EARLYBIRD20 - 20% off for early shoppers
- VIP25 - 25% off for email subscribers
- THANKYOU15 - 15% off for past customers

**Advantage:** Spreads out orders, reduces fulfillment crush in December

![Promo code discount strategy](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607082348824-0a96f2a4b9da?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

### Black Friday/Cyber Monday Codes (November)

**Goal:** Maximum sales volume

**Examples:**
- BFCM30 - 30% off sitewide (biggest discount of year)
- FLASH40 - 40% off for 6 hours only (creates urgency)
- CYBER50 - 50% off select items (move specific inventory)

**Structure:**
- Friday: Best overall discount (30-40% off)
- Saturday: Category-specific (30% off outerwear)
- Sunday: Bundle deals (Buy 2 get 1 free)
- Monday: Final hours (35% off + free shipping)

**Stacking strategy:**
- Base discount + extra for bundles
- Example: "30% off everything + extra 10% off when you buy a bundle" = SAVE40BUNDLE

### Gift Giver Codes (December)

**Goal:** Make gifting easy and attractive

**Examples:**
- GIFTGIVER20 - 20% off orders $100+
- FREESHIP - Free shipping (no minimum)
- LASTMINUTE15 - 15% off + express shipping discount
- WRAPPING - Free gift wrapping (added value without cutting profit)

**Minimum thresholds:**
- HOLIDAY15 - 15% off orders $75+
- HOLIDAY20 - 20% off orders $125+
- HOLIDAY25 - 25% off orders $200+

Encourages higher cart values.

![Black Friday Cyber Monday deals](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1607082349566-187342175e2f?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

### Post-Holiday Codes (January)

**Goal:** Clear inventory, retain customers

**Examples:**
- THANKYOU30 - 30% off for holiday buyers
- NEWYEAR25 - 25% off sitewide (January sales)
- CLEARANCE50 - 50% off holiday items (clear seasonal stock)

**How to implement promo codes:**

**In Shopify Admin:**
1. Go to Discounts
2. Create discount code
3. Set type: Percentage, Fixed amount, or Free shipping
4. Set requirements: Minimum purchase, specific collections, customer groups
5. Set usage limits: One per customer, total usage limit
6. Set dates: Start and end times (auto-activate/deactivate)

**Pro tips:**

**Don't publicize all codes:**
- Some codes are for email subscribers only (creates value)
- Some codes are for cart abandoners (recovery)
- Some codes are for VIPs (loyalty reward)

**Stack strategically:**
- Bundle discount + promo code = powerful
- Free shipping + percentage off = high conversion

**Test discount levels:**
- Start conservatively (15-20%)
- Increase if not hitting targets (25-30%)
- BFCM can go higher (30-40%)

**Communicate clearly:**
- "Use code HOLIDAY20 for 20% off orders $75+"
- State minimums and exclusions upfront
- Show countdown timer for time-limited codes

## Strategy #3: Build Holiday Gift Guides

91% of US adults plan to celebrate winter holidays. Most are looking for gift ideas.

Gift guides = free traffic + simplified shopping + higher conversions.

**Types of gift guides to create:**

### 1. "Gifts Under $X" Guides

- Gifts Under $25
- Gifts Under $50
- Gifts Under $100

**Why it works:** Shoppers have budgets. Make it easy.

![Gift guide shopping](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512909006721-3d6018887383?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

### 2. "Gifts For [Person]" Guides

- Gifts for Him
- Gifts for Her
- Gifts for Kids
- Gifts for Teens
- Gifts for Parents
- Gifts for Coworkers

**Why it works:** Removes decision paralysis.

### 3. "Best [Category] Gifts" Guides

- Best Tech Gifts 2025
- Best Beauty Gifts 2025
- Best Home Gifts 2025

**Why it works:** SEO gold. People search "best [X] gifts" constantly.

### 4. Personality-Based Guides

- Gifts for Coffee Addicts
- Gifts for Fitness Fanatics
- Gifts for Homebodies
- Gifts for Adventure Seekers

**Why it works:** More specific = more relevant = higher conversion.

**How to build gift guides:**

**Option 1: Dedicated landing page**

Use [GemPages or PageFly](/blog/how-to-create-custom-pages-gempages-complete-guide) to create custom page:
- Hero section: "2025 Holiday Gift Guide"
- Categories: Click to jump to section
- Product grids with images, prices, quick add-to-cart
- CTA: "Shop All Gifts"

**Option 2: Blog post**

Use Shopify blog:
- Write "15 Perfect Gifts for [Person]" post
- Embed product links throughout
- SEO optimized (ranks in Google)
- Shareable on social

**Option 3: Collection pages**

Create Shopify collections:
- "Gifts for Him" collection
- Filter by price
- Add description and buying tips

![Holiday gift guide layout](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1545558014-8692077e9b5c?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

**Gift guide optimization:**

**Images:**
- Lifestyle shots, not white backgrounds
- Show products being used/enjoyed
- Add text overlay: "Gifts for Coffee Lovers"

**Copy:**
- Why each item makes a great gift
- Who it's perfect for
- Price point clearly visible

**CTAs:**
- "Add to Cart"
- "Shop Now"
- "View Gift Set"

**Promotion:**
- Email to list (segment by interest)
- Pin on Pinterest (huge gift discovery platform)
- Share on Instagram Stories with product tags
- Run ads to "2025 Gift Guide" landing page

## Strategy #4: Optimize Store Design for Holidays

Your store should FEEL festive. Not tacky. Festive.

**What to update:**

### Homepage

- Hero banner: Holiday messaging
  - "Holiday Gift Guide 2025"
  - "Free Shipping on Orders $75+ | Order by Dec 20"
  - "Shop Gifts Under $50"
- Countdown timer: "Shop Now - Only X Days Until Christmas"
- Featured: Gift bundles, bestsellers, gift cards
- Trust badges: "Free returns through January"

![Festive ecommerce homepage](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1512389142860-9c449e58a543?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

### Navigation menu

- Add "Holiday Gifts" or "Gift Guide" to main menu
- Quick links to "Gifts For Him", "Gifts For Her", "Gifts Under $50"
- Highlight with festive color or icon

### Product pages

- Add "Perfect gift for [person]" messaging
- Show "Free gift wrapping available" option
- Display "Order by [date] for Christmas delivery"
- Cross-sell: "Complete the gift with..."

### Collection pages

- Holiday-specific collections front and center
- Sort by price (helps gift shoppers)
- Filter by "Gift-ready" or "Bundles"

### Checkout

- Add gift message option (text field)
- Offer gift wrapping (+$5-10)
- Show delivery date estimate
- Display return policy ("Easy returns through Jan 31")

**Color scheme:**
- Don't go overboard with red/green
- Subtle festive touches: gold accents, winter blues, whites
- Keep brand consistent (just add holiday elements)

**Festive elements (use sparingly):**
- Snowflakes falling (but not distracting)
- Holiday banner across top
- Festive icons (gifts, snowflakes, stars)

![Holiday website design elements](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1482517967863-00e15c9b44be?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

**Apps for holiday themes:**
- Snowfall Effect ($2-5/mo) - animated snowflakes
- Promo Bar ($5-10/mo) - holiday messaging bar
- Holiday Theme Editor (free in Shopify theme editor)

**Mobile optimization:**

70% of traffic is mobile. Your holiday design MUST work on phones.

Test:
- Hero images load fast
- Text is readable (no tiny fonts)
- Buttons are tappable (48px minimum)
- Navigation menu accessible
- Checkout works smoothly

## Strategy #5: Prepare for Peak Traffic & Orders

Nothing kills holiday sales faster than a crashed site or inventory running out.

### Site speed optimization

Holiday traffic = 3-5x normal. Your site needs to handle it.

**Audit now:**
- Run Google PageSpeed Insights
- Target: Under 3 seconds load time (mobile)
- If over 5 seconds, you're in trouble

**Quick fixes:**
- Compress images (use TinyIMG app)
- Remove unused apps (each app slows site)
- Upgrade hosting plan if needed
- Use Shopify's CDN (built-in)

![Website performance optimization](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1460925895917-afdab827c52f?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

### Inventory management

**Forecast demand:**
- Look at last year's holiday sales
- Add 20-30% buffer for growth
- Factor in new products

**Stock up early:**
- Order inventory by August/September
- Account for shipping delays
- Communicate with suppliers about lead times

**Low stock alerts:**
- Set up notifications when inventory drops below threshold
- Display "Only 3 left in stock" on product pages (creates urgency)
- Plan for restocks mid-season

**What to do if you run out:**

Don't just show "Out of Stock."

Options:
- "Back in stock by [date] - Pre-order now"
- "Join waitlist - we'll notify you"
- "Similar items you'll love" (recommend alternatives)

### Shipping strategy

**Shipping deadlines:**

Calculate and communicate clearly:
- Standard shipping: Order by Dec 18 for Christmas
- 2-Day shipping: Order by Dec 22 for Christmas
- Overnight: Order by Dec 23 for Christmas

**Display everywhere:**
- Homepage banner
- Product pages
- Cart page
- Checkout
- Email footer

![Shipping and delivery deadlines](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1566576721346-d4a3b4eaeb55?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

**Shipping options:**

Offer multiple:
- Standard (free over $X)
- Express (2-day)
- Overnight

Price express reasonably. Don't gouge last-minute shoppers—they'll remember.

**Free shipping:**

Most powerful incentive during holidays.

Strategies:
- "Free shipping on orders $75+" (set threshold 20% above your AOV)
- "Free shipping on all gifts" (for gift bundles)
- "Free shipping Dec 1-24" (promotional period)

Show progress: "Add $12 more for free shipping!"

**International shipping:**

If you ship internationally:
- Add extra buffer for delivery estimates
- State customs delays possible
- Recommend ordering by early December

## Strategy #6: Email Marketing Campaign Sequences

Email drives 20-30% of holiday revenue. Have a plan.

**The holiday email calendar:**

### October

- Email 1: "Get Ready - Holiday Shopping Starts Early This Year"
- Email 2: "Early Bird Deal - 20% Off Gift Bundles"
- Email 3: "Our Holiday Gift Guide is Here"

### November (Black Friday/Cyber Monday)

- Week before BF: "Black Friday Preview - Save the Date"
- Thursday: "Tomorrow: Our Biggest Sale of the Year"
- Friday AM: "IT'S HERE - 30% Off Everything"
- Friday PM: "Final Hours - Black Friday Ends Midnight"
- Saturday: "Cyber Weekend Continues - 30% Off"
- Sunday: "Last Day - Cyber Monday Preview"
- Monday AM: "Cyber Monday - 35% Off + Free Shipping"
- Monday PM: "Final Call - Sale Ends in 6 Hours"

![Email marketing campaign](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563986768609-322da13575f3?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

### December (Gift Season)

- Email 1: "Stress-Free Gift Shopping - We've Got You"
- Email 2: "Gifts Under $50 (Perfect for Everyone)"
- Email 3: "Order by Dec 18 for Christmas Delivery"
- Email 4: "Last Call for Guaranteed Delivery"
- Email 5: "Digital Gift Cards - Perfect Last-Minute Gift"

### Post-Holiday (January)

- Email 1: "Thank You + Here's 15% Off Your Next Order"
- Email 2: "New Year Sale - 30% Off Sitewide"
- Email 3: "Last Chance - Sale Ends Tonight"

**Segmentation:**

Don't send same emails to everyone.

Segments:
- **VIP customers** (purchased 3+ times) - early access, higher discounts
- **New subscribers** (joined in last 30 days) - welcome series + holiday offer
- **Cart abandoners** - "You left items in your cart + here's 10% off"
- **Past holiday buyers** - "You shopped with us last year - welcome back!"

**Email elements that work:**

**Subject lines:**
- "🎁 Our Holiday Gift Guide is Here"
- "Final Hours - 30% Off Ends Midnight"
- "Stress-Free Gifts Under $50"
- Keep under 50 characters (mobile preview)

**Preview text:**
- First line after subject
- "Shop curated gift bundles with free shipping..."
- Don't repeat subject line

**Body:**
- Hero image (festive, eye-catching)
- Clear headline
- 1-2 sentence intro
- Product grid or featured items (3-6 products)
- Single clear CTA ("Shop Gifts" or "Get 30% Off")
- Shipping deadline reminder at bottom

**Apps for email:**
- Klaviyo ($20-100/mo) - best for advanced segmentation
- Shopify Email (free) - works for basic campaigns
- Omnisend ($16-100/mo) - good middle ground

## Strategy #7: Payment Flexibility (Buy Now, Pay Later)

$18.2 billion in holiday sales used Buy Now, Pay Later last year.

If you don't offer it, you're losing sales.

**Why BNPL works during holidays:**

People want to give great gifts but have budgets. BNPL lets them:
- Buy $200 gift, pay $50/month for 4 months
- Split cost across paychecks
- Avoid credit card debt

![Buy now pay later payment options](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556742393-d75f468bfcb0?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

**BNPL options for Shopify:**

**Shop Pay Installments (built into Shopify):**
- Free for merchants
- Customers split into 4 payments
- Orders $50-3,000 eligible
- Most seamless option

**Afterpay:**
- 4 interest-free payments
- Popular with Gen Z and Millennials
- Integration easy

**Klarna:**
- 4 payments OR monthly financing
- Pink badge stands out
- Strong brand recognition

**Affirm:**
- Monthly payments for larger purchases
- Good for high-ticket items ($500+)
- Clear terms

**How to implement:**

1. Enable in Shopify Payments settings
2. Add BNPL badges to product pages
   - "Or 4 payments of $25 with Afterpay"
   - Show calculation automatically
3. Mention in emails
   - "Give the gift they'll love. Pay over time with Afterpay."
4. Highlight on bundles
   - "$150 bundle = 4 payments of $37.50"

**Results:**

Stores that add BNPL see:
- 20-30% increase in AOV
- 10-15% increase in conversion rate
- Lower cart abandonment

It's literally free money (for you). Just enable it.

## Strategy #8: Post-Holiday Strategy (Retain Those Customers)

The holiday season doesn't end December 25. Smart stores plan for January too.

**Post-holiday tactics:**

### Thank you emails

Send within 24 hours of delivery:
- "Thank you for your order!"
- Ask for review (incentivize with 10% off next order)
- Include care instructions or tips for product

### Feedback requests

2 weeks after purchase:
- "How's your [product]?"
- Link to review form
- Offer to resolve issues

![Customer retention strategy](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556761175-4b46a572b786?q=80&w=2070&auto=format&fit=crop)

### Post-holiday sale

December 26 - January:
- "After Christmas Sale - 30% Off"
- Position as clearing inventory
- Make room for new products

### Returns & exchanges

Extend holiday return window:
- "All holiday purchases can be returned through January 31"
- Builds trust
- Encourages buying (less risk)

Handle returns gracefully:
- Easy return process (pre-paid label)
- Fast refunds
- Offer exchanges or store credit first

### Loyalty program invites

Convert one-time holiday buyers into repeats:
- "Join our VIP program - get 15% off your next order"
- "Earn points on every purchase"
- "Early access to sales"

You can also consider implementing [subscription options](/blog/best-shopify-subscription-apps-2026-comparison) for products that work well as recurring purchases.

### Re-engagement campaigns

February-March:
- "We miss you! Here's 20% off"
- "New arrivals just for you"

## Common Holiday Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Waiting until November to prep

By then, it's too late for inventory, bundles, and proper planning. Start in August.

### Mistake #2: Not having shipping deadlines

Customers need to know when to order. If you don't tell them, they'll order late and blame you.

### Mistake #3: Running out of bestsellers

Nothing worse than "Sorry, sold out" during peak season. Stock deep on winners.

### Mistake #4: Terrible mobile experience

70% of traffic is mobile. If your site sucks on phones, you're losing 70% of potential sales.

### Mistake #5: No gift options

No gift wrapping, no gift message option, no bundles = missed opportunity. Make gifting EASY.

### Mistake #6: Generic messaging

"Holiday sale" is boring. "Stress-free gifts for everyone on your list" is specific and helpful.

### Mistake #7: Ignoring email

Email drives 20-30% of holiday revenue. If you're not sending daily emails during BFCM, you're leaving money on the table.

### Mistake #8: Forgetting post-holiday

The sale doesn't end December 25. Plan for returns, January sales, and retaining those new customers.

## Real Numbers: What's Actually Possible

Here's what well-prepared stores see during holidays:

**Revenue:**
- Q4 typically accounts for 40-60% of annual revenue
- BFCM weekend alone can be 15-25% of Q4 revenue

**Traffic:**
- 3-5x normal traffic during peak days
- 10-15x normal traffic on Black Friday

**Conversion rate:**
- Often drops slightly (more browsers) but volume makes up for it
- Bundles convert 20-30% higher than individual products

**AOV:**
- Increases 15-30% during holidays (gift bundles, BNPL)
- Free shipping thresholds pull AOV higher

**Email performance:**
- Open rates: 20-30% (higher during holidays)
- Click rates: 3-5%
- Revenue per email: $0.50-2.00 (higher for segmented campaigns)

**Example:**

Store doing $50K/month normally:
- October (early prep): $60K (+20%)
- November (BFCM): $150K (+200%)
- December (holidays): $120K (+140%)
- Q4 total: $330K vs Q1-Q3 average of $150K

**That's an extra $180K in Q4 alone.**

Worth preparing for? Yeah, I'd say so.

## The Bottom Line

Most Shopify stores do the same lazy holiday prep:

- Slap a "Holiday Sale" banner up in late November
- Offer generic 20% off
- Hope for the best

And they get mediocre results.

The stores that dominate Q4:
- Start planning in August
- Create strategic gift bundles
- Build comprehensive promo code systems
- Launch gift guides that actually help customers
- Optimize every element for mobile
- Have clear shipping strategies
- Run sophisticated email campaigns
- Make post-holiday retention a priority

It's more work. But the payoff is 2-3x holiday revenue compared to lazy competitors.

Start now. Build bundles this week. Plan your promo codes. Design your gift guides.

By the time Black Friday hits, you'll be ready to execute while everyone else scrambles.
