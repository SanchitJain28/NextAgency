Your agency’s homepage is the digital storefront for your services, targeting WooCommerce (and Shopify) store owners seeking a headless Next.js frontend to boost speed, SEO, and scalability while retaining their existing dashboards. It should reflect your expertise in eCommerce optimization, align with your **Sell Alpha** Shopify app, and convert visitors into leads for your migration services (₹75,000–₹5,00,000) and maintenance plans (₹5,000–₹30,000/month). Drawing from your focus on solving performance issues (like your books website) and the finalized blog topics, the homepage must be visually appealing, SEO-optimized, and action-oriented, emphasizing the benefits of combining WooCommerce’s flexibility with Shopify-like performance. Below, I’ll outline a homepage structure, design elements, content sections, and SEO strategies tailored for your agency in 2025, ensuring it drives traffic (500–1,000 visitors/month) and conversions (20–30% lead rate). I’ll assume you’re using Next.js for the homepage (to showcase your expertise) and targeting Indian SMBs and global eCommerce clients.

### Gotchas
- **Clarity**: Ensure non-technical SMBs understand “headless” (e.g., “Your dashboard stays; the storefront gets faster”).
- **Branding**: Use your agency name (e.g., **GrowFast Studio**, **EcomSurge**) consistently. If undecided, placeholder works for now.
- **Shopify Balance**: Highlight Shopify benefits without alienating WooCommerce users (emphasize hybrid solution).
- **Performance**: Test homepage load time (aim for <2s) to reflect your speed promise.
